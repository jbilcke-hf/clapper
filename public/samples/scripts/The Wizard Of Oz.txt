For nearly forty years this story has given faithful

        Don't bother us now, honey -- this
        old incubator's gone bad, and we're
        likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

                  DOROTHY
        Oh -- oh, the poor little things.
        Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit
        Toto right over the back with a
        rake just because she says he gets
        in her garden and chases her nasty
        old cat every day.

                  AUNT EM
        Seventy -- Dorothy, please!

                  DOROTHY
        Oh, but he doesn't do it every day
        -- just once or twice a week. And
        he can't catch her old cat, anyway.
        And now she says she's gonna get
        the sheriff, and --

                  AUNT EM

        you know, she ought to have
        somebody to play with.

                  AUNT EM
        I know, but we all got to work out
        our own problems, Henry.

                  UNCLE HENRY
        Yes.

        Okay.

        There you are.

        It's a lucky thing it wasn't your

            Zeke, what am I going to do about
            Miss Gulch? Just because Toto
            chases her old cat --

                      ZEKE
            Listen, honey, I got them hogs to
            get in.

                      HUNK
            Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't
            using your head about Miss Gulch.
            Think you didn't have any brains at
            all.

                      DOROTHY
            I have so got brains.

                      HUNK
            Well, why don't you use them? When
            you come home, don't go by Miss
            Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get
            in her garden, and you won't get in
            no trouble. See?

                      DOROTHY
            Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen,
            that's all.

                      HUNK
            Well, your head ain't made of
            straw, you know.

                      HICKORY
            Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are
            rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let
            Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch.
            She's just a poor sour-faced old
            maid that -- she ain't got no heart
            left. You know, you should have a
            little more heart yourself, and
            have pity on her.

                      DOROTHY
            Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
                                                           5.


                  HICKORY
        Now look, here's something that
        really has a heart. This is the
        best invention I ever invented.

                   DOROTHY
        This?

                  HICKORY
        Sure. It's to break up winds, so we
        don't have no more dust storms. Can
        you imagine what it'll mean to this
        section of the country? I'll show
        you. It works perfectly now. Here's
        the principle. You see that fan --
        that sends up air currents into the
        sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop
        it!

                   DOROTHY
        Oh!

                  HICKORY
        Who did it? Now wait a minute.

                   DOROTHY
        Hickory!

                  HICKORY
        Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk
        did that.

        Say! Get in there before I make a
        dime bank out of you! Listen, kid,
        are you going to let that old Gulch
        heifer try and buffalo you?

MCS -- Zeke poring feed into trough -- speaks --

                  ZEKE
        She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
        Have a little courage, that's all.

MCS -- Zeke picks up another bucket of feed -- pours it
into trough --

        walk right up to her and spit in
        her eye. That's what I'd do!

        Are you all right, Dorothy?

        What's the matter -- gonna let a
        little old pig make a coward out of

          HICKORY
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as
white --

          AUNT EM
Here, here, what's all this jabber-
wapping when there's work to be
done? I know three shiftless farm
hands that'll be out of a job
before they know it!

          HICKORY
Well, Dorothy was walking along the

          AUNT EM
I saw you tinkering with that
contraption, Hickory. Now, you and
Hunk get back to that wagon!

          HICKORY
All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day
they're going to erect a statue to
me in this town, and --

          AUNT EM
Well, don't start posing for it
now. Here, here -- can't work on an
empty stomach. Have some crullers.

          HUNK
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.

You see, Dorothy toppled in with
the big Duroc...

        Yes'am.

                  DOROTHY
        Auntie Em, really -- you know what
        Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to
        Toto? She said she was gonna --

                  AUNT EM
        Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining
        things. You always get yourself
        into a fret over nothing.

                  DOROTHY
        No --

                  AUNT EM
        Now, you just help us out today,

        Do you suppose there is such a
        place, Toto? There must be. It's
        not a place you can get to by a
        boat or a train. It's far, far away
        -- behind the moon -- beyond the
        rain --

                  DOROTHY
             (sings)
        Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up
        high, There's a land that I heard
        of once in a lullaby. Somewhere,
        over the rainbow, skies are blue,
        And the dreams that you dare to
        dream really do....

        And wake up where the clouds are
        far behind me. Where troubles melt
        like lemon drops, Away above the
        chimney tops, That's where you'll
        find me. Somewhere, over the
        rainbow, bluebirds fly. Birds fly
        over the rainbow, Why then -- oh,
        why can't I? If happy little
        bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow
        Why, oh, why can't I?

                  MISS GULCH
        That dog's a menace to the
        community. I'm taking him to the
        sheriff and make sure he's
        destroyed.

                  DOROTHY
        Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You
        mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
        You won't let her, will you?

                  UNCLE HENRY
        Of course we won't. Will we, Em?

                  DOROTHY
        Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean
        to. He didn't know he was doing
        anything wrong. I'm the one that
        ought to be punished. I let him go
        in her garden. You can send me to
        bed without supper --

If you don't hand over that dog,
I'll bring a damage suit that'll
take your whole farm! There's a law
protecting folks against dogs that
bite!

          AUNT EM
How would it be if she keeps him
tied up? He's really gentle -- with
gentle people, that is.

          MISS GULCH
Well, that's for the Sheriff to
decide. Here's his order allowing
me to take him. Unless you want to
go against the law.

          UNCLE HENRY
Uhh -- yeah --

          AUNT EM
Now, we can't go against the law,
Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will
have to go.

        I'm afraid you've made rather a bad
        enemy of the Wicked Witch of the
        West. The sooner you get out of Oz

        way I came.

        Well, then, you'll have to walk.
        The Munchkins will see you safely

        remember, never let those ruby
        slippers off your feet for a
        moment, or you will be at the mercy
        of the Wicked Witch of the West.

        simply because you run away from

        are called heroes. Once a year,
        they take their fortitude out of
        mothballs and parade it down the
        main street of the city. And they
        have no more courage than you have.

        until one day, while performing
        spectacular feats of stratospheric
        skill never before attempted by
        civilized man, an unfortunate
        phenomena occurred. The balloon
        failed to return to the fair.

                     LION
        It did?

        Frightened? You are talking to a
        man who has laughed in the face of
        death -- sneered at doom and
        chuckled at catastrophe. I was
        petrified. Then suddenly the wind
        changed, and the balloon floated
        down into the heart of this noble
        city, where I was instantly
        acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de
        Luxe!

        quick get-away.
