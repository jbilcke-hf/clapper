                                                                1.



    A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

    A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
    title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup
    slowly crawls into infinity.

    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking
    from a hidden base, have won their first victory against
    the evil Galactic Empire.

    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret
    plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an
    armored space station with enough power to destroy an
    entire planet.

    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia
    races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen
    plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the
    galaxy...

    The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
    eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
    silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
    from the back of the ship, races through space. It is
    pursed by a giant Imperial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of
    deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Star Destroyer,
    causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to
    disintegrate.


1   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY                     1

    An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
    D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
    through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
    old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
    face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
    Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
    human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
    surface of an Art Deco design.

    Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                      THREEPIO
            Did you hear that? They've shut
            down the main reactor. We'll be
            destroyed for sure. This is
            madness!

    Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions
    in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the
    door.
                                                                2.


                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            We're doomed!

    The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
    only another robot could understand.

                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            There'll be no escape for the
            Princess this time.

    Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
    loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy
    equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the
    ship.

                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            What's that?


2   EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE                                         2

    The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
    Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
    underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.


3   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER                                       3

    The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
    tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
    a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
    their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

    In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
    laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random
    patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter
    and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several
    Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke,
    holding shattered arms and faces.

    An explosion hits near the robots.

                      THREEPIO
            I should have known better than to
            trust the logic of a half-sized
            thermocapsulary dehousing
            assister...

    Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
    around the two hapless robots.


4   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY                           4
                                                             3.


    A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
    The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
    figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
    who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
    hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but
    lovable lad with a prize-winning smile.

    A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
    large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
    desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
    by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little
    robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky
    motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's
    eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars
    from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few
    moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his
    dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like
    transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a
    magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow
    him.

                      LUKE
            Hurry up! Come with me! What are
            you waiting for?! Get in gear!

    The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
    smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his
    arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps
    into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum
    madly.


5   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY                     5

    The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes
    his way into the blinding light of the main passageway.
    This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is
    obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath
    mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored
    suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively
    backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet
    sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel
    troops break and run in a frenzied panic.


6   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER                                    6

    A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
    Artoo makes beeping sounds.


7   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER                                    7
                                                             4.


    Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
    nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
    soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                      THREEPIO
            Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

    A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
    he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
    filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years
    old) stands in front of Artoo.

    Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the
    smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer
    face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.

                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            At last! Where have you been?

    Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            They're heading in this direction.
            What are we going to do? We'll be
            sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
            smashed into who knows what!

    Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
    subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

                      THREEPIO (CONT’D)
            Wait a minute, where are you going?

    Artoo responds with electronic beeps.


8   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR                         8

    The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted
    bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the
    neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                      IMPERIAL OFFICER
            The Death Star plans are not in the
            main computer.

    Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
    in vain.

                      VADER
            Where are those transmissions you
            intercepted?
                                                              5.


     Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                       VADER (CONT’D)
             What have you done with those
             plans?

                       REBEL OFFICER
             We intercepted no transmissions.
             Aaah... This is a consular ship.
             Were on a diplomatic mission.

                       VADER
             If this is a consular ship... were
             is the Ambassador?

     The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
     Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating
     a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes
     limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and
     turns to his troops.

                       VADER (CONT’D)
             Commander, tear this ship apart
             until you've found those plans and
             bring me the Ambassador. I want her
             alive!

     The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.


9    INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY                       9

     The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
     stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
     Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her
     eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds
     of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the
     troopers spots her.

                       TROOPER
             There she is! Set for stun!

     Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
     her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
     paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
             She'll be all right. Inform Lord
             Vader we have a prisoner.


10   INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY                       10

     Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.
     He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
     begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into
     the cramped four-man pod.

                       THREEPIO
             Hey, you're not permitted in there.
             It's restricted. You'll be
             deactivated for sure..

     Artoo beeps something to him.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Don't call me a mindless
             philosopher, you overweight glob of
             grease! Now come out before
             somebody sees you.

     Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
     the mission he is about to perform.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Secret mission? What plans? What
             are you talking about? I'm not
             getting in there!

     Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he
     beeps and twangs angrily.

     A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and
     debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at
     Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from
     Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             I'm going to regret this.


11   INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER                                     11

     On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two
     terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel
     spacecraft.

                       CHIEF PILOT
             There goes another one.

                       CAPTAIN
             Hold your fire. There are no life
             forms. It must have been short-
             circuited.
                                                                7.

     Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial
     starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the
     galaxy.

                       THREEPIO
             That's funny, the damage doesn't
             look as bad from out here.

     Artoo beeps an assuring response.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Are you sure this things safe?

12A EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY 12A

     Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
     buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty
     empty street of the tiny settlement.

     An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding
     vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past.

                       WOMAN
             I've told you kids to slow down!


14   INT. POWER STATION - DAY                                        14

     Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a
     rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has
     been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through
     the office, yelling wildly.

                       FIXER
             Did I hear a young noise blast
             through here?

                       CAMIE
             It was just wormie on another
             rampage.

     Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
     and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
     playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
     handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy
     city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics
     of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the
     background.
                                                                 8.


                       LUKE
             Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

     Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to
     great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear
     hug.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             I didn't know you were back! When
             did you get in?

                       BIGGS
             Just now. I wanted to surprise you,
             hot shot. I thought you'd be
             here... certainly didn't expect you
             to be out working.
                  (he laughs)

                       LUKE
             The Academy didn't change you
             much...but you're back so soon?
             Hey, what happened, didn't you get
             your commission?

     Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                       BIGGS
             Of course I got it. Signed aboard
             The Rand Ecliptic last week. First
             mate Biggs Darklighter at your
             service...
                  (he salutes)
             ...I just came to say good-bye to
             all you unfortunate landlocked
             simpletons.

     Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing
     friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps
     out of it.

                       LUKE
             I almost forgot. There's a battle
             going on! Right here in our system.
             Come and look!

                       DEAK
             Not again! Forget it.

             The group stumbles out into the
             stifling desert sun. Camie and The
             Fixer complain and are forced to
             shade their eyes. Luke has his
             binoculars out scanning the
             heavens.

                       LUKE
             There they are!

     Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain
     to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
     Biggs sees two small silver specks.

                       BIGGS
             That's no battle, hot shot...
             they're just sitting there!
             Probably a freighter-tanker
             refueling.

                       LUKE
             But there was a lot of firing
             earlier...

     Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
     building in the process. Luke grabs them.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Hey, easy with those...

                       CAMIE
             Don't worry about it, Wormie.

     The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy
     shrugs his shoulders in resignation.

                       FIXER
             I keep telling you, the Rebellion
             is a long way from here. I doubt if
             the Empire would even fight to keep
             this system. Believe me Luke, this
             planet is a big hunk of nothing...

     Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
     group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
     Luke's ineptitude.

                                                        10.


Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a
squad of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she
is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the
briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as
Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark
Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she
doesn't move.

                  LEIA
        Lord Vader, I should have known.
        Only you could be so bold. The
        Imperial Senate will not sit for
        this, when they hear you've
        attacked a diplomatic...

                  VADER
        Don't play games with me, Your
        Highness. You weren't on any mercy
        mission this time. You passed
        directly through a restricted
        system. Several transmissions were
        beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
        I want to know what happened to the
        plans they sent you.

                  LEIA
        I don't know what you're talking
        about. I'm a member of the Imperial
        Senate on a diplomatic mission to
        Alderaan...

                  VADER
        You're a part of the Rebel
        Alliance... and a traitor. Take her
        away!

Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the
smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An
Imperial Commander turns to Vader.

                  COMMANDER
        Holding her is dangerous. If word
        of this gets out, it could generate
        sympathy for the Rebellion in the
        senate.

                  VADER
        I have traced the Rebel spies to
        her. Now she is my only link to
        find their secret base!

                  COMMANDER
                                                                11.


             She'll die before she tells you
             anything.

                       VADER
             Leave that to me. Send a distress
             signal and then inform the senate
             that all aboard were killed!

     Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the
     Commander. They stop and snap to attention.

                       SECOND OFFICER
             Lord Vader, the battle station
             plans are not aboard this ship! And
             no transmissions were made. An
             escape pod was jettisoned during
             the fighting, but no life forms
             were aboard.

     Vader turns to the Commander.

                       VADER
             She must have hidden the plans in
             the escape pod. Send a detachment
             down to retrieve them. See to it
             personally, Commander. There'll be
             no one to stop us this time.

                         COMMANDER
             Yes, sir.


17   EXT. SPACE                                                       17

     The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
     planet Tatooine.


18   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT                                           18

     Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
     meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
     kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and
     clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The
     lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                       THREEPIO
             How did I get into this mess? I
             really don't know how. We seem to
             be made to suffer. It's our lot in
             life.

     Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
                                                           12.


                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        I've got to rest before I fall
        apart. My joints are almost frozen.

Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        What a desolate place this is.

Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and
starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas.
Threepio stops and yells at him.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        Where are you going?

A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
robot.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        Well, I'm not going that way. It's
        much too rocky. This way is much
        easier.

Artoo counters with a long whistle.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        What makes you think there are
        settlements over there?

Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        Don't get technical with me.

Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        What mission? What are you talking
        about? I've had just about enough
        of you! Go that way! You'll be
        malfunctioning within a day, you
        nearsighted scrap pile!

Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in
the direction of the vast dune sea.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        And don't let me catch you
        following me begging for help,
        because you won't get it.
                                                             13.


     Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
     off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             No more adventures. I'm not going
             that way.

     Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the
     distant mountains.


19   EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA                                      19

     Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
     dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for
     endless miles. He looks back in the direction of the now
     distant rock mesas.

                       THREEPIO
             That malfunctioning little twerp.
             This is all his fault! He tricked
             me into going this way, but he'll
             do no better.

     In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the
     sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a
     glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object
     moving towards him.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm
             saved!

     The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
     approaching transport.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Over here! Help! Please, help!

19A EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY 19A

     Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer
     and the others can be heard working inside.

                       LUKE
                  (Very animated)
                                                        14.


        ...so I cut off my power, shut down
        the afterburners and came in low on
        Deak's trail. I was so close I
        thought I was going to fry my
        instruments. As it was I busted up
        the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle
        Owen was pretty upset. He grounded
        me for the rest of the season. You
        should have been there... it was
        fantastic.

                  BIGGS
        You ought to take it easy Luke. You
        may be the hottest bushpilot this
        side of Mos Eisley, but those
        little Skyhoppers are dangerous.
        Keep it up, and one day, whammo,
        you're going to be nothing more
        than a dark spot on the down side
        of a canyon wall.

                  LUKE
        Look who's talking. Now that you've
        been around those giant starships
        you're beginning to sound like my
        uncle. You've gotten soft in the
        city...

                  BIGGS
        I've missed you kid.

                  LUKE
        Well, things haven't been the same
        since you left, Biggs. It's been
        so... quiet.

Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                  BIGGS
        Luke, I didn't come back just to
        say good-bye... I shouldn't tell
        you this, but you're the only one I
        can trust... and if I don't come
        back, I want somebody to know.

Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                  LUKE
        What are you talking about?

                  BIGGS
        I made some friends at the Academy.
             (he whispers)
                                                        15.


        ...when our frigate goes to one of
        the central systems, we're going to
        jump ship and join the Alliance...

Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                  LUKE
        Join the Rebellion?! Are you
        kidding! How?

                  BIGGS
        Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth
        bigger than a meteor crater!

                  LUKE
        I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
             (he whispers)
        Listen how quiet I am. You can
        barely hear me...

Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                  BIGGS
        My friend has a friend on Bestine
        who might help us make contact.

                  LUKE
        You're crazy! You could wander
        around forever trying to find them.

                  BIGGS
        I know it's a long shot, but if I
        don't find them I'll do what I can
        on my own... It's what we always
        talked about. Luke, I'm not going
        to wait for the Empire to draft me
        into service. The Rebellion is
        spreading and I want to be on the
        right side -- the side I believe
        in.

                  LUKE
        And I'm stuck here...

                  BIGGS
        I thought you were going to the
        Academy next term. You'll get your
        chance to get off this rock.

LUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has
been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...
they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
                                                               16.


     BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of
     Sandpeople with one blaster.

     LUKE I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make
     the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I
     can't leave him now.

     BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn
     what seems to be important or what really is important.
     What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by
     the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize
     commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before
     your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater
     glory of the Empire.

     LUKE It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The
     Empire won't bother with this rock.

     BIGGS Things always change.

     LUKE I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?

     BIGGS No, I'm leaving in the morning...

     LUKE Then I guess I won't see you.

     BIGGS Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

                       LUKE
             Well, I'll be at the Academy next
             season... after that who knows. I
             won't be drafted into the Imperial
             Starfleet that's for sure... Take
             care of yourself, you'll always be
             the best friend I've got.

                       BIGGS
             So long, Luke.

     Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the
     power station.


21   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET                            21

     The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
     foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly
     creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the
     creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking
     noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound
     and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues
     on his way.
                                                               17.


     In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon
     wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A
     little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light
     reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet
     from the narrow path.

     The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
     suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots
     out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He
     manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over
     onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then
     on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no
     taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons
     as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby
     cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing
     eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as
     they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry
     him off down the trail.


22   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET              22

     The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge
     tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They
     weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him
     under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the
     little robot is sucked into the giant machine.

     The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
     and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.


23   INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA                                    23

     It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
     switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
     around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
     metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
     maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic
     whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door
     at the end of the chamber.


24   INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA                                  24

     Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the
     middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of
     various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic
     conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of
     recognition calls out from the gloom.

                       THREEPIO
             Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
                                                             18.


     A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.


25   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET            25

     The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
     twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
     ridge.


26   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY                                  26

     Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the
     half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to
     Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                       FIRST TROOPER
             Someone was in the pod. The tracks
             go off in this direction.

     A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
     and gives it to the first trooper.

                       SECOND TROOPER
             Look, sir -- droids.


27   EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES                                         27

     The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.


28   INT. SANDCRAWLER                                              28

     Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
     prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

                       THREEPIO
             Wake up! Wake up!

     Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,
     creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
     Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer
     lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the
     long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with
     blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way
     through the odd assortment of robots.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             We're doomed.

     A Jawa starts moving toward them.
                                                             19.


                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Do you think they'll melt us down?

     Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this
             never end?


29   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON           29

     The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
     battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front
     of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
     homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
     surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one
     small adobe block house.

     The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,
     straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented
     metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell
     horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when
     their mouths and nostrils should be.

     Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen
     Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish
     eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer
     carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by
     his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the
     vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an
     animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

     A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
     homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt
     Beru standing in the main courtyard.

                       BERU
             Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a
             translator to be sure it speaks
             Bocce.

                       LUKE
             It looks like we don't have much of
             a choice but I'll remind him.

     Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
     for sale with the Jawa leader.

                       OWEN
             I have no need for a protocol
             droid.
                                      20.


          THREEPIO
     (quickly)
Sir -- not in an environment such
as this -- that's why I've also
been programmed for over thirty
secondary functions that...

          OWEN
What I really need is a droid that
understands the binary language of
moisture vaporators.

          THREEPIO
Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was
programming binary load lifter...
very similar to your vaporators.
You could say...

          OWEN
Do you speak Bocce?

          THREEPIO
Of course I can, sir. It's like a
second language for me... I'm as
fluent in Bocce...

          OWEN
All right shut up!
     (turning to Jawa)
I'll take this one.

          THREEPIO
Shutting up, sir.

          OWEN
Luke, take these two over to the
garage, will you?
     (MORE)

          OWEN (CONT'D)
I want you to have both of them
cleaned up before dinner.

          LUKE
But I was going into Toshi Station
to pick up some power converters...

          OWEN
You can waste time with your
friends when your chores are done.
Now come on, get to it!

         LUKE
                                                        21.


        All right, come on! And the red
        one, come on. Well, come on, Red,
        let's go.

As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back
into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep
and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained
by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the
head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks
wildly.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        Uncle Owen...

                  OWEN
        Yeah?

                  LUKE
        This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
        Look!

                  OWEN
             (to the head Jawa)
        Hey, what're you trying to push on
        us?

The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has
sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to
attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio
taps Luke on the shoulder.

                  THREEPIO
             (pointing to Artoo)
        Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is
        in prime condition. A real bargain.

                  LUKE
        Uncle Owen...

                  OWEN
        Yeah?

                  LUKE
        What about that one?

                  OWEN
             (to Jawa)
        What about that blue one? We'll
        take that one.
                                                             22.


     With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the
     damaged astro-droid for Artoo.

                       LUKE
             Yeah, take it away.

                       THREEPIO
             Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very
             pleased with that one, sir. He
             really is in first-class condition.
             I've worked with him before. Here
             he comes.

     Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots
     trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                       LUKE
             Okay, let's go.

                       THREEPIO
                  (to Artoo)
             Now, don't you forget this! Why I
             should stick my neck out for you is
             quite beyond my capacity!


30   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON            30

     The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
     atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers
     himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the
     battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery
     with a cord to his face.

                       THREEPIO
             Thank the maker! This oil bath is
             going to feel so good. I've got
             such a bad case of dust
             contamination, I can barely move!

     Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in
     thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small
     two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the
     garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him
     and he slams a wrench across the workbench.

                       LUKE
             It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is
             right. I'm never gonna get out of
             here!

                       THREEPIO
                                                         23.


        Is there anything I might do to
        help?

Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger
drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                  LUKE
        Well, not unless you can alter
        time, speed up the harvest, or
        teleport me off this rock!

                  THREEPIO
        I don't think so, sir. I'm only a
        droid and not very knowledgeable
        about such things. Not on this
        planet, anyways. As a matter of
        fact, I'm not even sure which
        planet I'm on.

                  LUKE
        Well, if there's a bright center to
        the universe, you're on the planet
        that it's farthest from.

                  THREEPIO
        I see, sir.

                  LUKE
        Uh, you can call me Luke.

                  THREEPIO
        I see, sir Luke.

                  LUKE
             (laughing)
        Just Luke.

                  THREEPIO
        And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg
        relations, and this is my
        counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.

                  LUKE
        Hello.

Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to
scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping
oil from his bronze body.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
                                                        24.


        You got a lot of carbon scoring
        here. It looks like you boys have
        seen a lot of action.

                  THREEPIO
        With all we've been through,
        sometimes I'm amazed we're in as
        good condition as we are, what with
        the Rebellion and all.

                  LUKE
        You know of the Rebellion against
        the Empire?

                  THREEPIO
        That's how we came to be in your
        service, if you take my meaning,
        sir.

                  LUKE
        Have you been in many battles?

                  THREEPIO
        Several, I think. Actually, there's
        not much to tell. I'm not much more
        than an interpreter, and not very
        good at telling stories. Well, not
        at making them interesting,
        anyways.

Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from
Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

                  LUKE
        Well, my little friend, you've got
        something jammed in here real good.
        Were you on a cruiser or...

The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke
tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch
three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel
senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The
image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in
the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

                  LEIA
        Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
        only hope.

                  LUKE
        What's this?
                                                        25.


Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for
Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the
sentence fragment over and over.

                  THREEPIO
        What is what?!? He asked you a
        question...
             (pointing to Leia)
        What is that?

Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an
answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat
the sentence fragment over and over.

                  LEIA
        Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
        only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
        You're my only hope.

                  THREEPIO
        Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.
        Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay
        it no mind.

Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                  LUKE
        Who is she? She's beautiful.

                  THREEPIO
        I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

                  LEIA
        Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

                  THREEPIO
        I think she was a passenger on our
        last voyage. A person of some
        importance, sir -- I believe. Our
        captain was attached to...

                  LUKE
        Is there more to this recording?

Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic
squeaks and a whistle.

                  THREEPIO
        Behave yourself, Artoo. You're
        going to get us in trouble. It's
        all right, you can trust him. He's
        our new master.
                                                          26.


Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        He says he's the property of Obi-
        Wan Kenobi, a resident of these
        parts. And it's a private message
        for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't
        know what he's talking about. Our
        last master was Captain Antilles,
        but with what we've been through,
        this little R2 unit has become a
        bit eccentric.

                  LUKE
        Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he
        means old Ben Kenobi?

                  THREEPIO
        I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
        know what he's talking about?

                  LUKE
        Well, I don't know anyone named
        Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out
        beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a
        strange old hermit.

Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
moments.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        I wonder who she is. It sounds like
        she's in trouble. I'd better play
        back the whole thing.

Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

                  THREEPIO
        He says the restraining bolt has
        short circuited his recording
        system. He suggests that if you
        remove the bolt, he might be able
        to play back the entire recording.

Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and
hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.

                  LUKE
        H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're
        too small to run away on me if I
        take this off! Okay.
                                                           27.


Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
Artoo's side.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        There you go.

The princess immediately disappears...

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        Well, wait a minute. Where'd she
        go? Bring her back! Play back the
        entire message.

Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in
embarrassment.

                  THREEPIO
        What message? The one you're
        carrying inside your rusty innards!

A women's voice calls out from another room.

                  AUNT BERU
        Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
robot.

                  LUKE
        All right, I'll be right there,
        Aunt Beru.

                  THREEPIO
        I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
        have picked up a slight flutter.

Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
hurries out of the room.

                  LUKE
        Well, see what you can do with him.
        I'll be right back.

                  THREEPIO
             (to Artoo)
        Just you reconsider playing that
        message for him.

Artoo beeps in response.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        No, I don't think he likes you at
        all.
                                                               28.


     Artoo beeps.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             No, I don't like you either.


31   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA                               31

     Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
     with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
     used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some
     bowls of food and starts for the dining area.

     Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with
     steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of
     red grain.

                       LUKE
             You know, I think that R2 unit we
             bought might have been stolen.

                       OWEN
             What makes you think that?

                       LUKE
             Well, I stumbled across a recording
             while I was cleaning him. He says
             he belongs to someone called Obi-
             Wan Kenobi.

     Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
     manages to control himself.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             I thought he might have meant old
             Ben. Do you know what he's talking
             about? Well, I wonder if he's
             related to Ben.

     Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                       OWEN
             That old man's just a crazy old
             wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take
             that R2 unit into Anchorhead and
             have its memory flushed. That'll be
             the end of it. It belongs to us
             now.

                       LUKE
             But what if this Obi-Wan comes
             looking for him?
                                                          29.


                  OWEN
        He won't, I don't think he exists
        any more. He died about the same
        time as your father.

                  LUKE
        He knew my father?

                  OWEN
        I told you to forget it. Your only
        concern is to prepare the new
        droids for tomorrow. In the morning
        I want them on the south ridge
        working out those condensers.

                  LUKE
        Yes, sir. I think those new droids
        are going to work out fine. In
        fact, I, uh, was also thinking
        about our agreement about my
        staying on another season. And if
        these new droids do work out, I
        want to transmit my application to
        the Academy this year.

Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
it.

                  OWEN
        You mean the next semester before
        harvest?

                  LUKE
        Sure, there're more than enough
        droids.

                  OWEN
        Harvest is when I need you the
        most. Only one more season. This
        year we'll make enough on the
        harvest so I'll be able to hire
        some more hands. And then you can
        go to the Academy next year.

Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his
uncle.

                  OWEN (CONT’D)
        You must understand I need you
        here, Luke.

                  LUKE
        But it's a whole 'nother year.
                                                                30.


                       OWEN
             Look, it's only one more season.

     Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                       LUKE
             Yeah, that's what you said last
             year when Biggs and Tank left.

                       AUNT BERU
             Where are you going?

                       LUKE
             It looks like I'm going nowhere. I
             have to finish cleaning those
             droids.

     Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen
     mechanically finishes his dinner.

                       AUNT BERU
             Owen, he can't stay here forever.
             Most of his friends have gone. It
             means so much to him.

                       OWEN
             I'll make it up to him next year. I
             promise.

                       AUNT BERU
             Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He
             has too much of his father in him.

                       OWEN
             That's what I'm afraid of.


32   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD                                   32

     The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a
     distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few
     moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the
     homestead.


33   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE                                     33

     Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in
     sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt
     similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates
     the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out
     a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.
                                                                31.


                       LUKE
             What are you doing hiding there?

     Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in
     sight.

                       THREEPIO
             It wasn't my fault, sir. Please
             don't deactivate me. I told him not
             to go, but he's faulty,
             malfunctioning; kept babbling on
             about his mission.

                       LUKE
             Oh, no!

     Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.


34   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD                                   34

     Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead
     and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped
     astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and
     on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his
     electrobinoculars.

                       THREEPIO
             That R2 unit has always been a
             problem. These astro-droids are
             getting quite out of hand. Even I
             can't understand their logic at
             times.

                       LUKE
             How could I be so stupid? He's
             nowhere in sight. Blast it!

                       THREEPIO
             Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go
             after him?

                       LUKE
             It's too dangerous with all the
             Sandpeople around. We'll have to
             wait until morning.

     Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                       OWEN
             Luke, I'm shutting the power down
             for the night.
                                                               32.


                       LUKE
             All right, I'll be there in a few
             minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

     He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             You know that little droid is going
             to cause me a lot of trouble.

                       THREEPIO
             Oh, he excels at that, sir.


35   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA                                     35

     Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis
     of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling
     of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                       OWEN
             Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be
             loafing now!


36   INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN                                   36

     The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru
     prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

                       OWEN
             Have you seen Luke this morning?

                       AUNT BERU
             He said he had some things to do
             before he started today, so he left
             early.

                       OWEN
             Uh? Did he take those two new
             droids with him?

                       AUNT BERU
             I think so.

                       OWEN
             Well, he'd better have those units
             in the south range repaired be
             midday or there'll be hell to pay!


37   EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY         37
                                                              33.


     The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as
     Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the
     vast wasteland.


38   INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -      38

                       DAY
             Luke leans over the back of the
             speeder and adjusts something in
             the motor compartment.

                       LUKE
                  (yelling)
             How's that.

     Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the
     wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this
             direction somewhere, but I don't
             see how that R2 unit could have
             come this far. We must have missed
             him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take
             this very well.

                       THREEPIO
             Sir, would it help if you told him
             it was my fault.

                        LUKE
                   (brightening)
             Sure. He needs you. He'd probably
             only deactivate you for a day or
             so...

                       THREEPIO
             Deactivate! Well, on the other hand
             if you hadn't removed his
             restraining bolt...

                       LUKE
             Wait, there's something dead ahead
             on the scanner. It looks like our
             droid... hit the accelerator.


39   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY         39
                                                                34.


     From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen
     gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground
     two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy
     desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of
     the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser
     rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature
     grabs the gun before it can be fired.

     The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes
     called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get
     into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems
     to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the
     rocky terrain.


40   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON                               40

     The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing
     tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as
     large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped
     horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken
     Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures'
     shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.


41   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR                              41

     The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon.
     Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder,
     stands before little Artoo.

                       LUKE
             Hey, whoa, just where do you think
             you're going?

     The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses
     menacingly behind the little runaway.

                       THREEPIO
             Master Luke here is your rightful
             owner. We'll have no more of this
             Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and
             don't talk to me about your
             mission, either. You're fortunate
             he doesn't blast you into a million
             pieces right here.

                       LUKE
             Well, come on. It's getting late. I
             only hope we can get back before
             Uncle Owen really blows up.

                       THREEPIO
                                                              35.


             If you don't mind my saying so,
             sir, I think you should deactivate
             the little fugitive until you've
             gotten him back to your workshop.

                       LUKE
             No, he's not going to try anything.

     Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of
     frantic whistles and screams.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             What's wrong with him now?

                       THREEPIO
             Oh my... sir, he says there are
             several creatures approaching from
             the southeast.

     Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                       LUKE
             Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on,
             let's have a look. Come on.


42   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY                      42

     Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
     scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the
     two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the
     young adventurer.

                       LUKE
             There are two Banthas down there
             but I don't see any... wait a
             second, they're Sandpeople all
             right. I can see one of them now.

     Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
     electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front
     of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a
     large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is
     startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff.
     He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and
     rattles down the side of the mountain.
                                                             36.


     The towering creature brings down his curved, double-
     pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck
     terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages
     to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to
     pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he
     is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister
     Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out
     a horrible shrieking laugh.


43   EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY                     43

     Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in
     the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the
     inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the
     speeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts
     and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then
     everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan
     is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the
     Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

     Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
     swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows
     even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears
     and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and
     weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark,
     penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi
     squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm
     boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks
     right at him.

                       BEN
             Hello there! Come here my little
             friend. Don't be afraid.

     Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and
     begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand
     on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

                       BEN (CONT’D)
             Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                       LUKE
             What happened?

                       BEN
             Rest easy, son, you've had a busy
             day. You're fortunate you're still
             in one piece.

                       LUKE
             Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to
             see you!
                                                        37.


                  BEN
        The Jundland wastes are not to be
        traveled lightly. Tell me young
        Luke, what brings you out this far?

                  LUKE
        Oh, this little droid! I think he's
        searching for his former master...
        I've never seen such devotion in a
        droid before... there seems to be
        no stopping him. He claims to be
        the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
        Is he a relative of yours? Do you
        know who he's talking about?

Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy
beard.

                  BEN
        Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now
        thats a name I haven't heard in a
        long time... a long time.

                  LUKE
        I think my uncle knew him. He said
        he was dead.

                  BEN
        Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                  LUKE
        You know him!

                    BEN
        Well   of course, of course I know
        him.   He's me! I haven't gone by the
        name   Obi-Wan since oh, before you
        were   born.

                  LUKE
        Then the droid does belong to you.

                  BEN
        Don't seem to remember ever owning
        a droid. Very interesting...

He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        I think we better get indoors. The
        Sandpeople are easily startled but
        they will soon be back and in
        greater numbers.

     Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic
     beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

                         LUKE
             Threepio!


44   EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY                    44

     Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and
     begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps.
     Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio
     lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken
     off.

     Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and
     then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until
     finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                       THREEPIO
             Where am I? I must have taken a bad
             step...

                       LUKE
             Can you stand? We've got to get out
             of here before the Sandpeople
             return.

                       THREEPIO
             I don't think I can make it. You go
             on, Master Luke. There's no sense
             in you risking yourself on my
             account. I'm done for.

     Artoo makes a beeping sound.

                       LUKE
             No, you're not. What kind of talk
             is that?

     Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little
     Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around
     suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs
     the air.

                       BEN
             Quickly, son... they're on the
             move.


45   INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING                                        45
                                                        39.


The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm,
as old Ben sits thinking.

                  LUKE
        No, my father didn't fight in the
        wars. He was a navigator on a spice
        freighter.

                  BEN
        That's what your uncle told you. He
        didn't hold with your father's
        ideals. Thought he should have
        stayed here and not gotten
        involved.

                  LUKE
        You fought in the Clone Wars?

                  BEN
        Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the
        same as your father.

                  LUKE
        I wish I'd known him.

                  BEN
        He was the best star-pilot in the
        galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I
        understand you've become quite a
        good pilot yourself. And he was a
        good friend. Which reminds me...

Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the
restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short
handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        I have something here for you. Your
        father wanted you to have this when
        you were old enough, but your uncle
        wouldn't allow it. He feared you
        might follow old Obi-Wan on some
        damned-fool idealistic crusade like
        your father did.

                  THREEPIO
        Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
        I'll close down for awhile.
                                                        40.


                  LUKE
        Sure, go ahead.

Ben hands Luke the saber.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        What is it?

                  BEN
        Your fathers lightsaber. This is
        the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as
        clumsy or as random as a blaster.

Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out
about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across
the ceiling.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        An elegant weapon for a more
        civilized time. For over a thousand
        generations the Jedi Knights were
        the guardians of peace and justice
        in the Old Republic. Before the
        dark times, before the Empire.

Luke hasn't really been listening.

                  LUKE
        How did my father die?

                  BEN
        A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who
        was a pupil of mine until he turned
        to evil, helped the Empire hunt
        down and destroy the Jedi Knights.
        He betrayed and murdered your
        father. Now the Jedi are all but
        extinct. Vader was seduced by the
        dark side of the Force.

                  LUKE
        The Force?

                  BEN
        Well, the Force is what gives a
        Jedi his power. It's an energy
        field created by all living things.
        It surrounds us and penetrates us.
        It binds the galaxy together.

Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
                                                           41.


        Now, let's see if we can't figure
        out what you are, my little friend.
        And where you come from.

                  LUKE
        I saw part of the message he was...

Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                  BEN
        I seem to have found it.

Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers
before his eyes.

                  LEIA
        General Kenobi, years ago you
        served my father in the Clone Wars.
        Now he begs you to help him in his
        struggle against the Empire. I
        regret that I am unable to present
        my father's request to you in
        person, but my ship has fallen
        under attack and I'm afraid my
        mission to bring you to Alderaan
        has failed.
             (MORE)

                  LEIA (CONT'D)
        I have placed information vital to
        the survival of the Rebellion into
        the memory systems of this R2 unit.
        My father will know how to retrieve
        it. You must see this droid safely
        delivered to him on Alderaan. This
        is our most desperate hour. Help
        me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only
        hope.

There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently
puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in
his eyes.

                  BEN
        You must learn the ways of the
        Force if you're to come with me to
        Alderaan.

                  LUKE
             (laughing)
                                                             42.


             Alderaan? I'm not going to
             Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's
             late, I'm in for it as it is.

                       BEN
             I need your help, Luke. She needs
             your help. I'm getting too old for
             this sort of thing.

                       LUKE
             I can't get involved! I've got work
             to do! It's not that I like the
             Empire. I hate it! But there's
             nothing I can do about it right
             now. It's such a long way from
             here.

                       BEN
             That's your uncle talking.

                       LUKE
                  (sighing)
             Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever
             going to explain this?

                       BEN
             Learn about the Force, Luke.

                       LUKE
             Look, I can take you as far as
             Anchorhead.
                  (MORE)

                       LUKE (CONT'D)
             You can get a transport there to
             Mos Eisley or wherever you're
             going.

                       BEN
             You must do what you feel is right,
             of course.


46   EXT. SPACE.                                                   46

     An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
     battle station: the Death Star!


47   INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM                             47
                                                          43.


Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black
conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,
is speaking.

                  TAGGE
        Until this battle station is fully
        operational we are vulnerable. The
        Rebel Alliance is too well
        equipped. They're more dangerous
        than you realize.

The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

                  MOTTI
        Dangerous to your starfleet,
        Commander, not to this battle
        station!

                  TAGGE
        The Rebellion will continue to gain
        a support in the Imperial Senate as
        long as....

Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut
short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial
outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful
ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand
and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes
his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands
behind him.

                  TARKIN
        The Imperial Senate will no longer
        be of any concern to us. I've just
        received word that the Emperor has
        dissolved the council permanently.
        The last remnants of the Old
        Republic have been swept away.

                  TAGGE
        That's impossible! How will the
        Emperor maintain control without
        the bureaucracy?

                  TARKIN
        The regional governors now have
        direct control over territories.
        Fear will keep the local systems in
        line. Fear of this battle station.

                  TAGGE
                                                        44.


        And what of the Rebellion? If the
        Rebels have obtained a complete
        technical readout of this station,
        it is possible, however unlikely,
        that they might find a weakness and
        exploit it.

                  VADER
        The plans you refer to will soon be
        back in our hands.

                  MOTTI
        Any attack made by the Rebels
        against this station would be a
        useless gesture, no matter what
        technical data they've obtained.
        This station is now the ultimate
        power in the universe. I suggest we
        use it!

                  VADER
        Don't be too proud of this
        technological terror you've
        constructed. The ability to destroy
        a planet is insignificant next to
        the power of the Force.

                  MOTTI
        Don't try to frighten us with your
        sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your
        sad devotion to that ancient
        religion has not helped you conjure
        up the stolen data tapes, or given
        you clairvoyance enough to find the
        Rebel's hidden fort...

Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's
spell.

                  VADER
        I find your lack of faith
        disturbing.

                  TARKIN
        Enough of this! Vader, release him!

                  VADER
        As you wish.

                  TARKIN
                                                             45.


             This bickering is pointless. Lord
             Vader will provide us with the
             location of the Rebel fortress by
             the time this station is
             operational. We will then crush the
             Rebellion with one swift stroke.


48   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND                                     48

     The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas
     Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble
     and scattered bodies.

                       LUKE
             It looks like Sandpeople did this,
             all right. Look, here are Gaffi
             sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...
             I never heard of them hitting
             anything this big before.

     Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                       BEN
             They didn't. But we are meant to
             think they did. These tracks are
             side by side. Sandpeople always
             ride single file to hide there
             numbers.

                       LUKE
             These are the same Jawas that sold
             us Artoo and Threepio.

                       BEN
             And these blast points, too
             accurate for Sandpeople. Only
             Imperial stormtroopers are so
             precise.

                       LUKE
             Why would Imperial troops want to
             slaughter Jawas?

     Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are
     inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             If they traced the robots here,
             they may have learned who they sold
             them to. And that would lead them
             home!
                                                                46.


     Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for
     the speeder and jumps it.

                       BEN
             Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

     Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with
     the burning Sandcrawler.


49   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND                                        49

     Luke races across the wasteland in his battered
     Landspeeder.


50   EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD                                   50

     The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps
     out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.
     Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great
     battle has taken place.

                       LUKE
             Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

     Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and
     uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He
     is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new
     resolve comes over him.


51   EXT. SPACE                                                       51

     Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.


52   INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR                             52

     Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
     several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is
     filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a
     giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                       VADER
             And, now Your Highness, we will
             discuss the location of your hidden
             Rebel base.

     The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it
     approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical
     arms bearing a large hypodermic needle.
                                                             47.


     The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway
     appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess
     are barely heard.


53   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND                                     53

     There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of
     the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the
     dead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to
     him.

                       BEN
             There's nothing you could have
             done, Luke, had you been there.
             You'd have been killed, too, and
             the droids would be in the hands of
             the Empire.

                         LUKE
             I want to   come with you to
             Alderaan.   There's nothing here for
             me now. I   want to learn the ways of
             the Force   and become a Jedi like my
             father.


54   EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND                                     54

     The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it
     zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff
     overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard
     array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A
     harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke
     adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy
     bluff where Ben is standing.

                       BEN
             Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will
             never find a more wretched hive of
             scum and villainy. We must be
             cautious.

     Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
     smile.


55   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET                           55

     The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several
     combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots.
     A Trooper questions Luke.
                                                             48.


                       TROOPER
             How long have you had these droids?

                       LUKE
             About three or four seasons.

                       BEN
             They're for sale if you want them.

                       TROOPER
             Let me see your identification.

     Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID
     while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                       BEN
             You don't need to see his
             identification.

                       TROOPER
             We don't need to see his
             identification.

                       BEN
             These are not the droids your
             looking for.

                       TROOPER
             These are not the droids we're
             looking for.

                       BEN
             He can go about his business.

                       TROOPER
             You can go about your business.

                       BEN
                  (to Luke)
             Move along.

                       TROOPER
             Move along. Move along.


56   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET                           56

     The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse
     cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange
     forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of
     burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and
     begins to fondle the speeder.
                                                             49.


                       THREEPIO
             I can't abide these Jawas.
             Disgusting creatures.

     As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa
     away.

                       LUKE
             Go on, go on. I can't understand
             how we got by those troopers. I
             thought we were dead.

                       BEN
             The Force can have a strong
             influence on the weak-minded. You
             will find it a powerful ally.

                       LUKE
             Do you really think we're going to
             find a pilot here that'll take us
             to Alderaan?

                       BEN
             Well, most of the best freighter
             pilots can be found here. Only
             watch your step. This place can be
             a little rough.

                       LUKE
             I'm ready for anything.

                       THREEPIO
             Come along, Artoo.


57   INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA                          57

     The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow
     Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy
     den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic
     alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At
     first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed,
     slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle
     over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a
     group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking
     Bartender stops Luke and the robots.

                       BARTENDER
             We don't serve their kind here!

     Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many
     outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's
     drift.
                                                           50.


                  LUKE
        What?

                  BARTENDER
        Your droids. They'll have to wait
        outside. We don't want them here.

Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the
Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome
creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly
glare.

Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                  LUKE
        Listen, why don't you wait out by
        the speeder. We don't want any
        trouble.

                  THREEPIO
        I heartily agree with you sir.

Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the
creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall
savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby
monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes
dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise
awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears
two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-
hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold.

Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit
disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation
between Ben and the giant Wookiee.

Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic
ear or whatever.

A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

                  CREATURE
        Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby
Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the
belligerent monstrosity.
                                                        51.


                  HUMAN
        He doesn't like you.

                  LUKE
        I'm sorry.

                  HUMAN
        I don't like you either.

The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some
unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young
adventurer.

                  HUMAN (CONT’D)
        Don't insult us. You just watch
        yourself. We're wanted men. I have
        the death sentence in twelve
        systems.

                  LUKE
        I'll be careful than.

                  HUMAN
        You'll be dead.

The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy.
His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in
behind Luke.

                  BEN
        This little one isn't worth the
        effort. Come let me buy you
        something...

A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the
young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing
through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-
looking liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster
draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels
it at old Ben. The bartender panics.

                  BARTENDER
        No blasters! No blaster!
                                                             52.


     With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to
     life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is
     cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies
     doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and
     precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his
     utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old
     man's abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has
     lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to
     normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room
     at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the
     old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee.

                       BEN
             This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate
             on a ship that might suit our
             needs.


58   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET                           58

     Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on
     an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
     droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches
     two stormtroopers in the street.

                       THREEPIO
             I don't like the look of this.


59   INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA                          59

     Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
     instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and
     follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is
     sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty
     years old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple,
     sentimental, and cocksure.

                       HAN
             Han Solo. I'm captain of the
             Millennium Falcon. Chewie here
             tells me you're looking for passage
             to the Alderaan system.

                       BEN
             Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

                       HAN
             Fast ship? You've never heard of
             the Millennium Falcon?

                       BEN
             Should I have?
                                                           53.


                  HAN
        It's the ship that made the Kessel
        run in less than twelve parsecs!

Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with
obvious misinformation.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        I've outrun Imperial starships, not
        the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
        I'm talking about the big Corellian
        ships now. She's fast enough for
        you, old man. What's the cargo?

                  BEN
        Only passengers. Myself, the boy,
        two droids, and no questions asked.

                  HAN
        What is it? Some kind of local
        trouble?

                  BEN
        Let's just say we'd like to avoid
        any Imperial entanglements.

                  HAN
        Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
        And it's going to cost you
        something extra. Ten thousand in
        advance.

                  LUKE
        Ten thousand? We could almost buy
        our own ship for that!

                  HAN
        But who's going to fly it, kid!
        You?

                  LUKE
        You bet I could. I'm not such a bad
        pilot myself! We don't have to sit
        here and listen...

                  BEN
        We haven't that much with us. But
        we could pay you two thousand now,
        plus fifteen when we reach
        Alderaan.

                  HAN
        Seventeen, huh!
                                                             54.


     Han ponders this for a few moments.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.
             We'll leave as soon as you're
             ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.

                       BEN
             Ninety-four.

                       HAN
             Looks like somebody's beginning to
             take an interest in your handiwork.

     Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers
     looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some
     questions. The bartender points to the booth.

                       TROOPER
             All right, we'll check it out.

     The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben
     are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

                       HAN
             Seventeen thousand! Those guys must
             really be desperate. This could
             really save my neck. Get back to
             the ship and get her ready.

             You'll have to sell your speeder.

                       LUKE
             That's okay. I'm never coming back
             to this planet again.

     As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien
     with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The
     creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English
     subtitles.

                       GREEDO
             Going somewhere, Solo?

                       HAN
                                                           55.


        Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I
        was just going to see your boss.
        Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding
the gun on him.

                  GREEDO
        It's too late. You should have paid
        him when you had the chance.
        Jabba's put a price on your head,
        so large that every bounty hunter
        in the galaxy will be looking for
        you. I'm lucky I found you first.

                  HAN
        Yeah, but this time I got the
        money.

                  GREEDO
        If you give it to me, I might
        forget I found you.

                  HAN
        I don't have it with me. Tell
        Jabba...

                  GREEDO
        Jabba's through with you. He has no
        time for smugglers who drop their
        shipments at the first sign of an
        Imperial cruiser.

                  HAN
        Even I get boarded sometimes. Do
        you think I had a choice?

Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

                  GREEDO
        You can tell that to Jabba. He may
        only take your ship.

                  HAN
        Over my dead body.

                  GREEDO
        That's the idea. I've been looking
        forward to killing you for a long
        time.

                  HAN
        Yes, I'll bet you have.
                                                             56.


     Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of
     light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as
     the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up
     and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some
     coins as he leaves.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Sorry about the mess.

             All systems are operational. What
             course shall we set?

                       TARKIN
             Perhaps she would respond to an
             alternative form of persuasion.

                       VADER
             What do you mean?

                       TARKIN
             I think it is time we demonstrate
             the full power of this station.
                  (to soldier)
             Set your course for Princess Leia's
             home planet of Alderaan.

                       TROOPER
             With pleasure.

                                                               57.


     Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a
     narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures
     hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men,
     monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways,
     whispering and hiding from the hot winds.

                       THREEPIO
             Lock the door, Artoo.

     One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves
     on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and
     Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the
     background.

                       TROOPER
             All right, check that side of the
             street. It's secure. Move on to the
             next door.

     The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

                       THREEPIO
             I would much rather have gone with
             Master Luke than stay here with
             you.

                       THREEPIO (CONT'D)
             I don't know what all the trouble
             is about, but I'm sure it must be
             your fault.

     Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             You watch your language!


65   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED           65

                       SPEEDER LOT
             Ben and Luke are standing in a
             sleazy used speeder lot, talking
             with a tall, grotesque, insect-like
             used speeder dealer. Strange exotic
             bodies and spindly-legged beasts
             pass

     by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some
     coins.

                       LUKE
                                                             58.


             He says it's the best he can do.
             Since the XP-38 came out, they're
             just not in demand.

                       BEN
             It will be enough.

     Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty
     alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-
     like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look
     at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly
     clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and
     watches them as they disappear down another alley.

                       BEN (CONT’D)
             If the ship's as fast as he's
             boasting, we ought to do well.


66   INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY                                     66

     Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and
     purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay.
     Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his
     scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a
     vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes
     on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.

                       JABBA
             Come on out, Solo!

     A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and
     they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee,
     Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                       HAN
             I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

                       JABBA
             I expected you would be.

                       HAN
             I'm not the type to run.

                       JABBA
                  (fatherly-smooth)
             Han, my boy, there are times when
             you disappoint me... why haven't
             you paid me? And why did you have
             to fry poor Greedo like that...
             after all we've been through
             together.
                                      59.


          HAN
You sent Greedo to blast me.

          JABBA
     (mock surprise)
Han, why you're the best smuggler
in the business. You're too
valuable to fry. He was only
relaying my concern at your delays.
He wasn't going to blast you.

          HAN
I think he thought he was. Next
time don't send one of those
twerps. If you've got something to
say to me, come see me yourself.

          JABBA
Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to
dump that shipment of spice... you
understand I just can't make an
exception. Where would I be if
every pilot who smuggled for me
dumped their shipment at the first
sign of an Imperial starship? It's
not good business.

          HAN
You know, even I get boarded
sometimes, Jabba.
     (MORE)

          HAN (CONT'D)
I had no choice, but I've got a
charter now and I can pay you back,
plus a little extra. I just need
some more time.

          JABBA
     (to his men)
Put your blasters away. Han, my
boy, I'm only doing this because
you're the best and I need you. So,
for an extra, say twenty percent
I'll give you a little more time...
but this is it. If you disappoint
me again, I'll put a price on your
head so large you won't be able to
go near a civilized system for the
rest of your short life.

         HAN
                                                               60.


             Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my
             pleasure.


67   EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY                              67

     Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay
     Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.
     Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.
     The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder
     lot. He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small
     transmitter.


68   INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94                      68

     Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is
     Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a
     large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that
     could only loosely be called a starship.

                       LUKE
             What a piece of junk.

     The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                       HAN
             She'll make point five beyond the
             speed of light. She may not look
             like much, but she's got it where
             it counts, kid. I've added some
             special modifications myself.

     Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about
     all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others
     to follow.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             We're a little rushed, so if you'll
             hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

     The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
     Solo.


69   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON                                          69

     Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the
     mighty engines of the starship.

     Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium
     Falcon passing Solo.

                       THREEPIO
             Hello, sir.


71   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET                             71

     Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad
     creature.

                       TROOPER
             Which way?

     The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking
     bay.

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
             All right, men. Load your weapons!


72   INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]                     72

     The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the
     docking bay entrance.

                       TROOPER
             Stop that ship!

     Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers
     rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire
     at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
             Blast 'em!

     Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots
     which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The
     pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button
     that slams the overhead entry shut.


73   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON                                          73

                       HAN
             Chewie, get us out of here!

     The group straps in for take off.

                       THREEPIO
             Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I
             hate space travel.
                                                                62.


74   EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS                             74

     The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the
     general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship
     rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears
     into the morning sky.


75   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                 75

     Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who
     chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.


76   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE                                     76

     The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.


77   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                 77

     Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.
     Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway,
     makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                       HAN
             It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
             Our passengers must be hotter than
             I thought. Try and hold them off.
             Angle the deflector shield while I
             make the calculations for the jump
             to light speed.


78   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE                                     78

     The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow
     planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial
     stardestroyers.


79   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                 79

     Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the
     galaxy spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into
     the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

                       HAN
             Stay sharp! There are two more
             coming in; they're going to try to
             cut us off.

             Why don't you outrun them? I
             thought you said this thing was
             fast.

                       HAN
             Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
             going to find yourself floating
             home. We'll be safe enough once we
             make the jump to hyperspace.
             Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
             We'll lose them!


80   EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE                                  80

     Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.


81   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                              81

     The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the
     window.

                       HAN
             Here's where the fun begins!

                       BEN
             How long before you can make the
             jump to light speed?

                       HAN
             It'll take a few moments to get the
             coordinates from the navi-computer.

     The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                       LUKE
             Are you kidding? At the rate
             they're gaining...

                       HAN
             Traveling through hyperspace isn't
             like dusting crops, boy! Without
             precise calculations we could fly
             right through a star or bounce too
             close to a supernova and that'd end
             your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

     The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red
     warning light begins to flash.

                       LUKE
             What's that flashing?
                                                                64.


                       HAN
             We're losing our deflector shield.
             Go strap yourself in, I'm going to
             make the jump to light speed.

     The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if
     crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship
     makes the jump to hyperspace.


82   EXT. SPACE                                                       82

     The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a
     second.


83   EXT. DEATH STAR                                                  83

84   INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM                                   84

     Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before
     Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen
     displaying a small green planet.

                       MOTTI
             We've entered the Alderaan system.

     Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her
     hands are bound.

                       LEIA
             Governor Tarkin,   I should have
             expected to find   you holding
             Vader's leash. I   recognized your
             foul stench when   I was brought on
             board.

                       TARKIN
             Charming to the last. You don't
             know how hard I found it signing
             the order to terminate your life!

                       LEIA
             I surprised you had the courage to
             take the responsibility yourself!

        Princess Leia, before your
        execution I would like you to be my
        guest at a ceremony that will make
        this battle station operational.
             (MORE)

                  TARKIN (CONT'D)
        No star system will dare oppose the
        Emperor now.

                  LEIA
        The more you tighten your grip,
        Tarkin, the more star systems will
        slip through your fingers.

                  TARKIN
        Not after we demonstrate the power
        of this station. In a way, you have
        determined the choice of the planet
        that'll be destroyed first. Since
        you are reluctant to provide us
        with the location of the Rebel
        base, I have chosen to test this
        station's destructive power... on
        your home planet of Alderaan.

                  LEIA
        No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have
        no weapons. You can't possibly...

                  TARKIN
        You would prefer another target? A
        military target? Then name the
        system!

Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

                  TARKIN (CONT’D)
        I grow tired of asking this. So
        it'll be the last time. Where is
        the Rebel base?

Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to
Alderaan.

                  LEIA
             (softly)
        Dantooine.

Leia lowers her head.

                  LEIA (CONT’D)
        They're on Dantooine.
                                                             66.


                       TARKIN
             There. You see Lord Vader, she can
             be reasonable.
                  (addressing Motti)
             Continue with the operation. You
             may fire when ready.

                       LEIA
             What?

                       TARKIN
             You're far too trusting. Dantooine
             is too remote to make an effective
             demonstration. But don't worry. We
             will deal with your Rebel friends
             soon enough.

                       LEIA
             No!

                       VADER
             Commence primary ignition.

     A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A
     hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.
     Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another
     lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A
     huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area
     and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.
     The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space
     dust.


86   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA                    86

     Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small
     "seeker" robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He
     falters, seems almost faint.

                       LUKE
             Are you all right? What's wrong?

                       BEN
             I felt a great disturbance in the
             Force... as if millions of voices
             suddenly cried out in terror and
             were suddenly silenced. I fear
             something terrible has happened.
                                                          67.


Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance.
Then he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        You'd better get on with your
        exercises.

Han Solo enters the room.

                  HAN
        Well, you can forget your troubles
        with those Imperial slugs. I told
        you I'd outrun 'em.

Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        Don't everyone thank me at once.

Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move
along a chess-type board.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
        about oh-two-hundred hours.

Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table
covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the
table has a small computer monitor embedded in it.
Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his
lanky fur- covered arms over his head.

                  THREEPIO
        Now be careful, Artoo.

Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his
stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures
to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses
Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the
tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small
companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        He made a fair move. Screaming
        about it won't help you.

                  HAN
             (interrupting)
        Let him have it. It's not wise to
        upset a Wookiee.

                  THREEPIO
                                                        68.


        But sir, nobody worries about
        upsetting a droid.

                  HAN
        That's 'cause droids don't pull
        people's arms out of their socket
        when they lose. Wookiees are known
        to do that.

                  THREEPIO
        I see your point, sir. I suggest a
        new strategy, Artoo. Let the
        Wookiee win.

Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems
frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his
head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his
movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.

                  BEN
        Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
        flowing through him.

                  LUKE
        You mean it controls your actions?

                  BEN
        Partially. But it also obeys your
        commands.

Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a
"seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with
antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to
one side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a
lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's
face. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly
moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this
time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits
Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose
with a burst of laughter.

                  HAN
        Hokey religions and ancient weapons
        are no match for a good blaster at
        your side, kid.

                  LUKE
        You don't believe in the Force, do
        you?

                  HAN
                                                        69.


        Kid, I've flown from one side of
        this galaxy to the other. I've seen
        a lot of strange stuff, but I've
        never seen anything to make me
        believe there's one all-powerful
        force controlling everything.
        There's no mystical energy field
        that controls my destiny.

Ben smiles quietly.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        It's all a lot of simple tricks and
        nonsense.

                  BEN
        I suggest you try it again, Luke.

Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his
eyes.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        This time, let go your conscious
        self and act on instinct.

                  LUKE
             (laughing)
        With the blast shield down, I can't
        even see. How am I supposed to
        fight?

                  BEN
        Your eyes can deceive you. Don't
        trust them.

Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker
into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then
drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around
blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt
which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets
out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        Stretch out with your feelings.

Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker
makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect
the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its
original position.

                  BEN (CONT’D)
        You see, you can do it.
                                                             70.


                       HAN
             I call it luck.

                       BEN
             In my experience, there's no such
             thing as luck.

                       HAN
             Look, going good against remotes is
             one thing. Going good against the
             living? That's something else.

     Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the
     control panel.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Looks like we're coming up on
             Alderaan.

     Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.

                       LUKE
             You know, I did feel something. I
             could almost see the remote.

                       BEN
             That's good. You have taken your
             first step into a larger world.

     Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the
     evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.

                       TARKIN
             Yes.

                       OFFICER CASS
             Our scout ships have reached
             Dantooine. They found the remains
             of a Rebel base, but they estimate
             that it has been deserted for some
             time. They are now conducting an
             extensive search of the surrounding
             systems.

                       TARKIN
             She lied! She lied to us!

                       VADER
             I told you she would never
             consciously betray the Rebellion.
                                                             71.

     The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange
     surreal light show surrounds the ship.


89   INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                              89

                       HAN
             Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut
             in the sublight engines.

     Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit
     window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in
     speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder
     and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward
     them, battering the sides of the ship.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             What the...? Aw, we've come out of
             hyperspace into a meteor shower.
             Some kind of asteroid collision.
             It's not on any of the charts.

     The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool
     in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing
     cockpit.

                       LUKE
             What's going on?

                       HAN
             Our position is correct, except...
             no, Alderaan!

                       LUKE
             What do you mean? Where is it?

                       HAN
             Thats what I'm trying to tell you,
             kid. It ain't there. It's been
             totally blown away.

                       LUKE
             What? How?

     Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins
     to settle down.
                                                             72.

             Destroyed... by the Empire!

                       HAN
             The entire starfleet couldn't
             destroy the whole planet. It'd take
             a thousand ships with more fire
             power than I've...

     A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled
     alarm starts humming.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             There's another ship coming in.

                       LUKE
             Maybe they know what happened.

                       BEN
             It's an Imperial fighter.

     Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts
     outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A
     tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit
     window.

                       LUKE
             It followed us!

                       BEN
             No. It's a short range fighter.

                       HAN
             There aren't any bases around here.
             Where did it come from?

             It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
             If they identify us, we're in big
             trouble.

                       HAN
             Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam
             it's transmissions.

                       BEN
             It'd be as well to let it go. It's
             too far out of range.

     vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

     The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny
     fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter
     until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it.
     Ben stands behind Chewbacca.

                       BEN
             A fighter that size couldn't get
             this deep into space on its own.

                       LUKE
             It must have gotten lost, been part
             of a convoy or something.

                       HAN
             Well, he ain't going to be around
             long enough to tell anyone about
             us.

     The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship
     as they race toward camera and disappear over head.

     The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or
     planet.

                       LUKE
             Look at him. He's headed for that
             small moon.

                       HAN
             I think I can get him before he
             gets there... he's almost in range.

     The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a
     monstrous spherical battle station.

                       BEN
             That's no moon! It's a space
             station.

                       HAN
             It's too big to be a space station.

                       LUKE
             I have a very bad feeling about
             this.

             Yeah, I think your right. Full
             reverse! Chewie, lock in the
             auxiliary power.

     The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates
     away toward the gargantuan battle station.

                       LUKE
             Why are we still moving towards it?

                       HAN
             We're caught in a tractor beam!
             It's pulling us in!

             kid. I'm in full power. I'm going
             to have to shut down. But they're
             not going to get me without a
             fight!

     Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.

                       BEN
             You can't win. But there are
             alternatives to fighting.

     As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the
     awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle
     station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of
     the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking
     ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged.


97   EXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS                               97

     The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking
     port control room and huge laser turret cannons.

     The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death
     Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers
     stand at attention in a central assembly area.

     A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in
     readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with
     weapons ready to fire.

             We've captured a freighter entering
             the remains of the Alderaan system.
             It's markings match those of a ship
             that blasted its way out of Mos
             Eisley.

             They must be trying to return the

             There's no one on board, sir.
             According to the log, the crew
             abandoned ship right after takeoff.
             It must be a decoy, sir. Several of
             the escape pods have been
             jettisoned.

                       VADER
             Did you find any droids?

                       OFFICER
             No, sir. If there were any on
             board, they must also have
             jettisoned.

                       VADER

104 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY                              104

    A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In
    a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant
    officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels
    suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi
    sticks his head out of a third locker.

                       LUKE
             Boy, it's lucky you had these
             compartments.

                       HAN
             I use them for smuggling. I never
             thought I'd be smuggling myself in
             them. This is ridiculous. Even if I
             could take off, I'd never get past
             the tractor beam.

                       BEN
             Leave that to me!

                       HAN
             Damn fool. I knew that you were
             going to say that!

                       BEN
             Who's the more foolish... the fool
             or the fool who follows him?

    Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca
    agrees.


105 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY                            105

    The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the
    two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

                       TROOPER
             The ship's all yours. If the
             scanners pick up anything, report
             it immediately. All right, let's
             go.
                                                            78.


    The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound
    is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

                       HAN'S VOICE
             Hey down there, could you give us a
             hand with this?

    The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of
    gunfire is heard.


106 INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE                106

    In a very small command office near the entrance to the
    pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and
    notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                       GANTRY OFFICER
             TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at
             your post? TX-four-one-two, do you
             copy?

    A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and
    waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating
    his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his
    head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an
    annoyed look.

                       GANTRY OFFICER (CONT’D)
             Take over. We've got a bad
             transmitter. I'll see what I can
             do.

    As the officer approaches the door, it slides open
    revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a
    momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-
    chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with
    one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but
    is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben
    and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke,
    also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his
    helmet.

                       LUKE
             You know, between his howling and
             your blasting everything in sight,
             it's a wonder the whole station
             doesn't know we're here.

                       HAN
             Bring them on! I prefer a straight
             fight to all this sneaking around.
                                                        79.


                  THREEPIO
        We found the computer outlet, sir.

Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of
the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it
carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

                  BEN
        Plug in. He should be able to
        interpret the entire Imperial
        computer network.

Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the
vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding
information to the little robot. After a few moments, he
beeps something.

                  THREEPIO
        He says he's found the main
        computer to power the tractor beam
        that's holding the ship here. He'll
        try to make the precise location
        appear on the monitor.

The computer monitor flashes readouts.

                  THREEPIO (CONT’D)
        The tractor beam is coupled to the
        main reactor in seven locations. A
        power loss at one of the terminals
        will allow the ship to leave.

Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

                  BEN
        I don't think you boys can help. I
        must go alone.

                  HAN
        Whatever you say. I've done more
        that I bargained for on this trip
        already.

                  LUKE
        I want to go with you.

                  BEN
        Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch
        over the droids.

                  LUKE
        But he can...
                                                           80.


                  BEN
        They must be delivered safely or
        other star systems will suffer the
        same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny
        lies along a different path than
        mine. The Force will be with you...
        always!

Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps
out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey
hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head
in agreement.

                  HAN
        Boy you said it, Chewie.

Han looks at Luke.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        Where did you dig up that old
        fossil?

                  LUKE
        Ben is a great man.

                  HAN
        Yeah, great at getting us into
        trouble.

                  LUKE
        I didn't hear you give any ideas...

                  HAN
        Well, anything would be better than
        just hanging around waiting for him
        to pick us up...

                  LUKE
        Who do you think...

Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
Luke goes over to him.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        What is it?

                  THREEPIO
        I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
        He says "I found her", and keeps
        repeating, "She's here."

                  LUKE
        Well, who... who has he found?
                                              81.


Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                  THREEPIO
        Princess Leia.

                  LUKE
        The princess? She's here?

                  HAN
        Princess? What's going on?

                  THREEPIO
        Level five. Detention block A A-
        twenty- three. I'm afraid she's
        scheduled to be terminated.

                  LUKE
        Oh, no! We've got to do something.

                  HAN
        What are you talking about?

                  LUKE
        The droid belongs to her. She's the
        one in the message... We've got to
        help her.

                  HAN
        Now, look, don't get any funny
        ideas. The old man wants us to wait
        right here.

                  LUKE
        But he didn't know she was here.
        Look, will you just find a way back
        into the detention block?

                  HAN
        I'm not going anywhere.

                  LUKE
        They're going to execute her. Look,
        a few minutes ago you said you
        didn't want to just wait here to be
        captured. Now all you want to do is
        stay.

                  HAN
        Marching into the detention area is
        not what I had in mind.

                  LUKE
        But they're going to kill her!
                                                     82.


                  HAN
        Better her than me...

                  LUKE
        She's rich.

Chewbacca growls.

                    HAN
        Rich?

                  LUKE
        Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you
        were to rescue her, the reward
        would be...

                    HAN
        What?

                  LUKE
        Well more wealth that you can
        imagine.

                  HAN
        I don't know, I can imagine quite a
        bit!

                  LUKE
        You'll get it!

                    HAN
        I better!

                  LUKE
        You will...

                  HAN
        All right, kid. But you'd better be
        right about this.

Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                  LUKE
        All right.

                  HAN
        What's your plan?

                  LUKE
        Uh... Threepio, hand me those
        binders there will you?

Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
                                                              83.


                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Okay. Now, I'm going to put these
             on you.

    Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Okay. Han, you put these on.

    Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

                       HAN
             Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know
             what he has in mind.

    The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face
    as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

                       THREEPIO
             Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for
             asking... but, ah... what should
             Artoo and I do if we're discovered
             here?

                       LUKE
             Lock the door!

                       HAN
             And hope they don't have blasters.

                       THREEPIO
             That isn't very reassuring.

    Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and
    start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.


107 INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE                107

    Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored
    suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.

    Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the
    trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a
    curious glance.

    Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

                       LUKE
             I can't see a thing in this helmet.
                                                               84.


    A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away
    by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and
    the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

    Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main
    passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot
    similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end
    of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then
    disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so
    fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an
    illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him.


109 INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY         109

                       AREA
             Luke and Han step forward to exit
             the elevator, but the door slides
             open behind them. The giant Wookiee
             and his two guards enter the old
             grey security station. Guards and
             laser gates are everywhere. Han
             whispers to Luke under his breath.

                       HAN
             This is not going to work.

                       LUKE
             Why didn't you say so before?

                       HAN
             I did say so before!


110 INT. DETENTION AREA                                              110

    Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer
    approaches the trio.

                       OFFICER
             Where are you taking this... thing?

    Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to
    shut up.

                       LUKE
             Prisoner transfer from Block one-
             one- three-eight.

                       OFFICER
                                                        85.


        I wasn't notified. I'll have to
        clear it.

The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in
the information. There are only three other troopers in the
area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of
the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one
of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

                  HAN
        Look out! He's loose!

                  LUKE
        He's going to pull us all apart.

                  HAN
        Go get him!

The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and
Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are
blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of
laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser
gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the
last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he
is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the
comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is
going on. He quickly checks the computer readout.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        We've got to find out which cell
        this princess of yours is in. Here
        it is... cell twenty-one-eight-
        seven. You go get her. I'll hold
        them here.

Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into
the buzzing comlink.

                  HAN (CONT’D)
             (sounding official)
        Everything is under control.
        Situation normal.

                  INTERCOM VOICE
        What happened?

                  HAN
             (getting nervous)
                                                            86.


             Uh... had a slight weapons
             malfunction. But, uh, everything's
             perfectly all right now. We're
             fine. We're all fine here, now,
             thank you. How are you?

                       INTERCOM VOICE
             We're sending a squad up.

                       HAN
             Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor
             leak here now. Give us a few
             minutes to lock it down. Large
             leak... very dangerous.

                       INTERCOM VOICE
             Who is this? What's your operating
             number?

    Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

                       HAN
             Boring conversation anyway.
                  (yelling down the hall)
             Luke! We're going to have company!


111 INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW                                    111

    Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door
    away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees
    the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping
    and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on
    her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and
    stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

                       LEIA
                  (finally)
             Aren't you a little short to be a
             stormtrooper?

    Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                       LUKE
             What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke
             Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

                       LEIA
             You're who?

                       LUKE
                                                            87.


             I'm here to rescue you. I've got
             your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben
             Kenobi.

                       LEIA
             Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

                        LUKE
             Come on!


112 INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM                             112

    Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the
    far end of the conference table.

                       VADER
             He is here...

                       TARKIN
             Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you
             think so?

                       VADER
             A tremor in the Force. The last
             time I felt it was in the presence
             of my old master.

                       TARKIN
             Surely he must be dead by now.

                       VADER
             Don't underestimate the power of
             the Force.

                       TARKIN
             The Jedi are extinct, their fire
             has gone out of the universe. You,
             my friend, are all that's left of
             their religion.

    There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

                        TARKIN (CONT’D)
             Yes.

                       INTERCOM VOICE
             Governor Tarkin, we have an
             emergency alert in detention block
             A A-twenty- three.

                        TARKIN
                                                               88.


             The princess! Put all sections on
             alert!

                       VADER
             Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with
             him.

                       TARKIN
             If you're right, he must not be
             allowed to escape.

                       VADER
             Escape is not his plan. I must face
             him alone.


113 INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY                       113

    An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the
    elevator door.

                       HAN
             Chewie!

    Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Get behind me! Get behind me!

    A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door
    through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

    Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke
    and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting
    up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Can't get out that way.

                       LEIA
             Looks like you managed to cut off
             our only escape route.

                       HAN
                  (sarcastically)
             Maybe you'd like it back in your
             cell, Your Highness.

    Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as
    they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making
    their way down the corridor.

                       LUKE
                                                            89.


             See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

                       THREEPIO
                  (over comlink)
             Yes sir?

                       LUKE
             We've been cut off! Are there any
             other ways out of the cell bay?...
             What was that? I didn't copy!


114 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER             114

    Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and
    whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small
    comlink transmitter.

                       THREEPIO
             I said, all systems have been
             alerted to your presence, sir. The
             main entrance seems to be the only
             way in or out; all other
             information on your level is
             restricted.

    Someone begins banging on the door.

                       TROOPER VOICE
             Open up in there!

                       THREEPIO
             Oh, no!


115 INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR                          115

    Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection
    as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and
    Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay
    at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very
    intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.

                       LUKE
             There isn't any other way out.

                       HAN
             I can't hold them off forever! Now
             what?

                       LEIA
                                                               90.


             This is some rescue. When you came
             in here, didn't you have a plan for
             getting out?

                       HAN
                  (pointing to Luke)
             He's the brains, sweetheart.

    Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

                       LUKE
             Well, I didn't...

    The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in
    the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

                       HAN
             What the hell are you doing?

                       LEIA
             Somebody has to save our skins.
             Into the garbage chute, wise guy.

    She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca
    look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute
    and says something.

                       HAN
             Get in there you big furry oaf! I
             don't care what you smell! Get in
             there and don't worry about it.

    Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the
    tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work
    their way toward the opening.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to
             kill her or I'm beginning to like
             her. Get in there!

    Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han
    fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover,
    then slides into the chute himself and is gone.


116 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                   116

    Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and
    muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit.
    He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It
    won't budge.
                                                             91.


                  HAN
             (sarcastically)
        Oh! The garbage chute was a really
        wonderful idea. What an incredible
        smell you've discovered! Let's get
        out of here! Get away from there...

                    LUKE
        No! wait!

Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The
laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.

Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt
explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the
garbage with a rather grim look on her face.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        Will you forget it? I already tried
        it. It's magnetically sealed!

                  LEIA
        Put that thing away! You're going
        to get us all killed.

                  HAN
        Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I
        had everything under control until
        you led us down here. You know,
        it's not going to take them long to
        figure out what happened to us.

                  LEIA
        It could be worse...

A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way   up from the
murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified   howl and
begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast   with their
laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering   near one of
the walls.

                  HAN
        It's worse.

                  LUKE
        There's something alive in here!

                  HAN
        That's your imagination.

                  LUKE
        Something just moves past my leg!
        Look! Did you see that?
                                                        92.


                    HAN
        What?

                    LUKE
        Help!

Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

                  HAN
        Luke! Luke! Luke!

Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air
and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped
around his throat.

                    LEIA
        Luke!

Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

                  LEIA (CONT’D)
        Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

                  LUKE
        Blast it, will you! My gun's
        jammed.

                    HAN
        Where?

                  LUKE
        Anywhere! Oh!!

Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the
muck by the slimy tentacle.

                  HAN
        Luke! Luke!

Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and
move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly
quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as
Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and
muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface.

                    LEIA
        Grab him!

Luke seems to be released by the thing.

                  LEIA (CONT’D)
        What happened?
                                                               93.


                       LUKE
             I don't know, it just let go of me
             and disappeared...

                       HAN
             I've got a very bad feeling about
             this.

    Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble
    and edge toward the Rebels.

                       LUKE
             The walls are moving!

                       LEIA
             Don't just stand there. Try to
             brace it with something.

    They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
    walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant
    trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too
    good.

                       LUKE
             Wait a minute!

    Luke pulls out his comlink.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Threepio! Come in Threepio!
             Threepio! Where could he be?


117 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE                   117

    A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for
    See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which
    is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and
    Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great
    explosion and the door of the control tower flies across
    the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

                       FIRST TROOPER
             Take over!
                  (pointing to the dead
                  officer)
             See to him! Look there!

    A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door
    slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo
    follows his bronze companion out into the office.

                       THREEPIO
                                                              94.


             They're madmen! They're heading for
             the prison level. If you hurry, you
             might catch them.

                       FIRST OFFICER
                  (to his troops)
             Follow me! You stand guard.

    The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to
    watch over the command office.

                       THREEPIO
                  (to Artoo)
             Come on!

    The guard aims a blaster at them.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Oh! All this excitement has overrun
             the circuits of my counterpart
             here. If you don't mind, I'd like
             to take him down to maintenance.

                       TROOPER
             All right.

    The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow,
    hurries out the door.


118 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                  118

    As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and
    smaller. Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back
    with his giant paws.

    Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is
    snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                       LUKE
             Threepio! Come in, Threepio!
             Threepio!

    Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a
    pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                       HAN
             Get to the top!

                       LEIA
             I can't

                       LUKE
                                                            95.


             Where could he be? Threepio!
             Threepio, will you come in?


119 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL            119

                       THREEPIO
             They aren't here! Something must
             have happened to them. See if
             they've been captured.

    Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall
    socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from
    the tiny robot.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Hurry!


120 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                120

    The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced
    against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at
    each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she
    holds it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as
    she feels the first crushing pressure against her body.

                       HAN
             One thing's for sure. We're all
             going to be a lot thinner!
                  (to Leia)
             Get on top of it!

                       LEIA
             I'm trying!


121 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL            121

                       THREEPIO
                  (to Artoo)
             Thank goodness, they haven't found
             them! Where could they be?

    Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I
             turned it off!


122 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                122
                                                             96.


    Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his
    head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz
    and he rips it off his belt.


123 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL             123

    Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be
    heard, but not distinctly.

                       THREEPIO
             Are you there, sir?


124 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                 124

                         LUKE
             Threepio!


125 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL             125

                       THREEPIO
             We've had some problems...

                       LUKE
                  (over comlink)
             Will you shut up and listen to me?
             Shut down all garbage mashers on
             the detention level, will you? Do
             you copy?


126 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                 126

                       LUKE
             Shut down all the garbage mashers
             on the detention level.


127 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL             127

                       LUKE
                  (over comlink)
             Shut down all the garbage mashers
             on the detention level.

                       THREEPIO
                  (to Artoo)
             No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

    Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible
    screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.
                                                              97.


                         THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             Listen   to them! They're dying,
             Artoo!   Curse my metal body! I
             wasn't   fast enough. It's all my
             fault!   My poor master!

                       LUKE
                  (over comlink)
             Threepio, we're all right!


128 INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM                                  128

    The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.
    The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace
    in the background.

                       LUKE
             We're all right. You did great.

    Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a
    number.

                       LUKE (CONT’D)
             Hey... hey, open the pressure
             maintenance hatch on unit number...
             where are we?


129 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL              129

                       HAN
                  (over comlink)
             Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.


130 INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH         130

    Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge
    tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.
    The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.
    The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading
    to a control panel that connects two large cables. He
    carefully makes several adjustments in the computer
    terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to
    blue.


131 INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY                                131

    The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused
    hallway. Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on
    the blaster belts.
                                                           98.


                  HAN
        If we can just avoid any more
        female advice, we ought to be able
        to get out of here.

Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster
from Solo.

                  LUKE
        Well, let's get moving!

Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the
garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

                  HAN
             (to Chewie)
        Where are you going?

The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy
tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a
victim. Han aims his pistol.

                  LEIA
        No, wait. They'll hear!

Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes
relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply
shakes his head in disgust.

                  HAN
             (to Chewie)
        Come here, you big coward!

Chewie shakes his head "no."

                  HAN (CONT’D)
        Chewie! Come here!

                  LEIA
        Listen. I don't know who you are,
        or where you came from, but from
        now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

                  HAN
        Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's
        get one thing straight! I take
        orders from one person! Me!

                  LEIA
        It's a wonder you're still alive.
             (looking at Chewie)
                                                            99.


             Will somebody get this big walking
             carpet out of my way?

    Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

                       HAN
             No reward is worth this.

    They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.


132 INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH                                132

    Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of
    stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly
    slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few
    feet of him.

                       OFFICER
             Secure this area until the alert is
             canceled.

                       FIRST TROOPER
             Give me regular reports.

    All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

                       FIRST TROOPER (CONT’D)
             Do you know what's going on?

                       SECOND TROOPER
             Maybe it's another drill.

    Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the
    stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures
    with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear
    something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force,
    Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main
    hallway.

                       SECOND TROOPER (CONT’D)
             What was that?

                       FIRST TROOPER
             Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about
             it.


133 INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY                                     133
                                                       100.


Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway
and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship.
Troopers are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his
pocket comlink.

                  HAN
             (looking at his ship)
        There she is.

                  LUKE
        See-Threepio, do you copy?

                  THREEPIO
             (voice)
        For the moment. Uh, we're in the
        main hangar across from the ship.

                  LUKE
        We're right above you. Stand by.

Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of
the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and
points out the window to the ship.

                  LEIA
        You came in that thing? You're
        braver that I thought.

                  HAN
        Nice! Come on!

Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the
hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty
Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are
taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

                  FIRST TROOPER
        It's them! Blast them!

Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and
charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the
stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down
the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the
floor.

                  HAN
             (to Luke and Leia)
        Get back to the ship!

                  LUKE
        Where are you going? Come back!

Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.
                                                            101.


                       LEIA
             He certainly has courage.

                       LUKE
             What good will it do us if he gets
             himself killed? Come on!

    Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for
    muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke
    and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.


134 INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY                                   134

    Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is
    yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach
    a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a
    few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The
    troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten
    troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the
    lone starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as
    the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they
    fire at him.


135 INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY                                   135

    Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt
    to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of
    laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han,
    pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a
    host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts
    running the other way also.


136 INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY                                   136

    Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down
    a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers.

    They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race
    through an open hatchway.


137 INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT                           137

    Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge
    that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into
    infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of
    the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses
    his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him,
    takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.
                                                       102.


                  LUKE
             (gasping)
        I think we took a wrong turn.

Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby
reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at
the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch
that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom,
leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of
bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to
hit the steel door.

                  LEIA
        There's no lock!

Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

                  LUKE
        That oughta hold it for a while.

                  LEIA
        Quick, we've got to get across.
        Find the control that extends the
        bridge.

                  LUKE
        Oh, I think I just blasted it.

Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the
stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making
ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

                  LEIA
        They're coming through!

Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when
laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser
pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge
overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire.
Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. A
trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest.

Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by
Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers
move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

                  LUKE
        Here, hold this.
                                                              103.


    Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility
    belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a
    bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works
    with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another
    trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire
    as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing
    the feet of more troops.

                       LEIA
             Here they come!

    Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and
    he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the
    gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes.
    He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs
    the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses
    him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

                         LEIA (CONT’D)
             For luck!

    Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss
    to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as
    Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the
    stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at
    the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into
    the tiny subhallway.


138 INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY                              138

    Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as
    several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He
    checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the
    hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at
    the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.


139 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY                               139

    Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the
    pirateship entry ramp.

                       THREEPIO
             Where could they be?

    Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome
    left and right, beeping a response.


140 INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR                  140

    Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several
    troopers hot on their trail.

                       TROOPER
             Close the blast doors!

    At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in
    front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion
    race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and
    manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing
    troops before the doors slam shut.

                       TROOPER (CONT’D)
             Open the blast doors! Open the
             blast doors!


141 INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY            141

    Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar
    where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the
    hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the
    tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also
    ignites his and steps slowly forward.

                       VADER
             I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
             We meet again, at last. The circle
             is now complete.

    Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical
    offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a
    defensive stance.

                       VADER (CONT’D)
             When I left you, I was but the
             learner; now I am the master.

                       BEN
             Only a master of evil, Darth.

    The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few
    moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right
    moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and
    strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon
    him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his
    eyes.

    Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked
    by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash
    stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the
    Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered.
                                                              105.


    Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the
    massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand
    motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in
    mid- air, creating a low buzzing sound.

                       VADER
             Your powers are weak, old man.

                       BEN
             You can't win, Darth. If you strike
             me down, I shall become more
             powerful than you can possibly
             imagine.

    Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.


142 INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY                               142

    Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back
    against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the
    Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

                       HAN
             Didn't we just leave this party?

    Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join
    them.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             What kept you?

                       LEIA
             We ran into some old friends.

                       LUKE
             Is the ship all right?

                       HAN
             Seems okay, if we can get to it.
             Just hope the old man got the
             tractor beam out of commission.


143 INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY                                        143

    Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they
    hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on
    impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and
    Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle
    from his group's vantage point.

                       LUKE
                                                              106.


             Look!

    Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader
    emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking
    bay.


144 INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY                                    144

    Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death
    Star's Imperial docking bay.

                       THREEPIO
             Come on, Artoo, we're going!

    Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who
    were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards
    Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.


145 INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY                                        145

    Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The
    troops rush toward the battling knights.

                       HAN
             Now's our chance! Go!

    They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops
    charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader
    takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings
    his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to
    deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

    The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts
    his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a
    serene look on his face.

    Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's
    cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in
    it. Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at
    the empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the
    adventurers and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees
    Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

                       LUKE
             No!
                                                           107.


    The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
    The robots are already moving up the ramp into the
    Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe,
    returns their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader
    looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers
    is struck down.

                       HAN
                  (to Luke)
             Come on!

                       LEIA
             Come on! Luke, its too late!

                       HAN
             Blast the door! Kid!

    Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it
    explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers
    charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a
    close behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out
    of the docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of
    his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing
    troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the
    pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles
    to the floor.

                       BEN'S VOICE
             Run, Luke! Run!

    Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He
    turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from
    the troopers and races into the ship.


146 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                              146

    Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.
    The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of
    the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

                       HAN
             I hope the old man got that tractor
             beam out if commission, or this is
             going to be a real short trip.
             Okay, hit it!

    Chewbacca growls in agreement.


147 EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON                                        147

    The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star
    docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into
    the vastness of space.


148 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA                    148

    Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off
    blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around
    him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She
    sits down beside him.


149 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                              149

    Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

                       HAN
                  (to Chewie)
             We're coming up on the sentry
             ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the
             deflector shields while I charge up
             the main guns!


150 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA                    150

    Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth,
    as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                       LUKE
             I can't believe he's gone.

    Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

                       LEIA
             There wasn't anything you could
             have done.

    Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with
    the princess.

                       HAN
                  (to Luke)
             Come on, buddy, we're not out of
             this yet!

    Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside
    gunport.

    heads for the cockpit.


153 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT                     153

    Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit,
    settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in
    large rotating turrets on either side of the ship.


154 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT                         154

    Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of
    his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

                       HAN

             You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

    Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for
    attacking TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed
    controls as the ship bounces slightly.


156 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT - COCKPIT               156

             The Imperial TIE fighters move
             towards the Millennium Falcon, one
             each veering off to the left and
             right of the pirateship.

    Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo.
    The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out
    in the room and then comes back on.


163 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS                   163

    A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and
    fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as
    the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a
    minor hit, and bounces slightly.

    A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The
    ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a
    cabinet fill of small computer chips.

                       THREEPIO
             Oooh!


171 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS                      171

    Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates
    the ship's controls.

                       LEIA
             We've lost lateral controls.

                       HAN
             Don't worry, she'll hold together.

    An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,
    causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

                       HAN (CONT’D)
                  (to ship)
             You hear me, baby? Hold together!

    Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control
    panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire
    retardant beeping all the while.

    A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms
    overhead.


177 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS                                177

    Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view,
    firing laserbeams from his cannon.


178 EXT. TIE FIGHTER                                                 178

    A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.


179 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS                                179

    Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a
    fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He
    connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han
    laughs victoriously.


180 EXT. SPACE                                                       180

    Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium
    Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.


181 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS                                181

    Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke,
    smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a
    spectacular direct hit.

                       LUKE
             Got him! I got him!

    Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke
    gleefully returns.

                       HAN
             Great kid! Don't get cocky.

    Han turns back to his laser cannon.


182 EXT. SPACE                                                       182

    Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.


183 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                 183

    While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns,
    looking over her shoulder out the ports.

                       LEIA
             There are still two more of them
             out there!

    A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing
    laserblasts at it.


185 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS                                185

    Luke and Han look into their respective projected target
    screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han
    swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his
    laser cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he
    reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen
    lighting his face.


186 EXT. SPACE                                                       186

    The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing
    destructive blasts at it.
                                                              114.


187 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS                                187

    Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter,
    and it bursts into a spectacular explosion.

    Luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit. The
    pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy
    fire.


188 EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER                                         188

    The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in,
    firing upon the Falcon.


189 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT                                 189

    Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc
    of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the
    pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon
    hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower
    of burning fragments.

                       LUKE
                  (laughing)
             That's it! We did it!

    The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory
    hug.

                       LEIA
             We did it!


190 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY                              190

    Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled
    in the smoking, sparking wires.

                       THREEPIO
             Help! I think I'm melting!
                  (to Artoo)
             This is all your fault.

    Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in
    response.


191 EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON                                   191

    The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically
    through space.

192 INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM                                192

    Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is
    watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before
    him.

                       TARKIN
             Are they away?

                       VADER
             They have just made the jump into
             hyperspace.

                       TARKIN
             You're sure the homing beacon is
             secure aboard their ship? I'm
             taking an awful risk, Vader. This
             had better work.


193 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                              193

    Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of
    the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the
    damage. Leia is seated near Han.

                       HAN
             Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You
             know, sometimes I even amaze
             myself.

                       LEIA
             That doesn't sound too hard.
             Besides, they let us go. It's the
             only explanation for the ease of
             our escape.

                       HAN
             Easy... you call that easy?

                       LEIA
             Their tracking us!

                       HAN
             Not this ship, sister.

    Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                       LEIA
             At least the information in Artoo
             is still intact.

                       HAN
                                                       116.


        What's so important? What's he
        carrying?

                  LEIA
        The technical readouts of that
        battle station. I only hope that
        when the data is analyzed, a
        weakness can be found. It's not
        over yet!

                  HAN
        It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't
        in this for your revolution, and
        I'm not in it for you, Princess.
             (MORE)

                  HAN (CONT'D)
        I expect to be well paid. I'm in it
        for the money!

                  LEIA
        You needn't worry about your
        reward. If money is all that you
        love, then that's what you'll
        receive!

She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,
passes Luke coming in.

                  LEIA (CONT’D)
        Your friend is quite a mercenary. I
        wonder if he really cares about
        anything... or anyone.

                  LUKE
        I care!

Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and
Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.

                  LUKE (CONT’D)
        So... what do you think of her,
        Han?

                  HAN
        I'm trying not to, kid!

                  LUKE
             (under his breath)
        Good...

                  HAN

             Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I
             don't know, what do you think? Do
             you think a princess and a guy like
             me...

                       LUKE
             No!

    Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at
    young Luke's jealousy.


194 EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN                          194

    The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet
    Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.


195 EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN                                       195

    An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the
    countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the
    temple, barely visible in the foliage.


197 EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE                           197

    Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple
    lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the
    fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and
    the others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

    Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an
    armored military speeder.


198 INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK                                198

    The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set
    up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the
    commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and
    gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                       WILLARD
                  (holding Leia)
             You're safe! We had feared the
             worst.

    Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

                       WILLARD (CONT’D)
             When we heard about Alderaan, we
             were afraid that you were... lost
             along with your father.

                        LEIA
             We don't have time for our sorrows,
             Commander. The battle station has
             surely tracked us here.
                   (looking pointedly to
                   Han)
             It's the only explanation for the
             ease of our escape. You must use
             the information in this R2 unit to
             plan the attack. It is our only
             hope.

    Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their
    discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to
    answer the call.

             Yes.

    A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin
    landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the

Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia
and several other senators are to one side of the giant
readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,
navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is
listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and
Chewbacca are standing near the back.

                  DODONNA
        The battle station is heavily
        shielded and carries a firepower
        greater than half the star fleet.
        It's defenses are designed around a
        direct large- scale assault. A
        small one-man fighter should be
        able to penetrate the outer
        defense.

Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties,
stands and addresses Dodonna.

                  GOLD LEADER
        Pardon me for asking, sir, but what
        good are snub fighters going to be
        against that?

                  DODONNA
        Well, the Empire doesn't consider a
        small one-man fighter to be any
        threat, or they'd have a tighter
        defense.

        An analysis of the plans provided

Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping
sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

                  DODONNA (CONT’D)
        The approach will not be easy. You
        are required to maneuver straight
        down this trench and skim the
        surface to this point. The target
        area is only two meters wide. It's
        a small thermal exhaust port, right
        below the main port. The shaft
        leads directly to the reactor
        system. A precise hit will start a
        chain reaction which should destroy
        the station.
                                                              120.


    A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

                       DODONNA (CONT’D)
             Only a precise hit will set up a
             chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
             shielded, so you'll have to use
             proton torpedoes.

    Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot
    about sixteen years old.

             That's impossible, even for a
             computer.

                       LUKE
             It's not impossible. I used to
             bull's- eye womp rats in my T-

             bigger than two meters.

             Man your ships! And may the Force
             be with you!

    The group rises and begins to leave.

207 INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK                      207

    Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship
    hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming
    spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute
    armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area
    isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca
    loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.

    Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter
    pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of
    his friend's departure.

                       LUKE
             So... you got your reward and
             you're just leaving then?

                       HAN
             That's right, yeah! I got some old
             debts I've got to pay off with this
             stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't
             think I'd be fool enough to stick
             around here, do you? Why don't you
             come with us? You're pretty good in
             a fight. I could use you.

                       LUKE
                  (getting angry)
             Come on! Why don't you take a look
             around?
                  (MORE)

                       LUKE (CONT'D)
             You know what's about to happen,
             what they're up against. They could
             use a good pilot like you. You're
             turning your back on them.

                       HAN
             What good's a reward if you ain't
             around to use it? Besides,
             attacking that battle station ain't
             my idea of courage. It's more like
             suicide.

                       LUKE
                                                           122.


             All right. Well, take care of
             yourself, Han. I guess that's what
             you're best at, isn't it?

    Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

                       HAN
             Hey, Luke... may the Force be with
             you!

    Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in
    a small wave and then goes off.

    Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

                       HAN (CONT’D)
             What're you lookin' at? I know what
             I'm doing.


208 INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP                           208

    Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                       LEIA
             What's wrong?

                       LUKE
             Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I
             really thought he'd change his
             mind.

                       LEIA
             He's got to follow his own path. No
             one can choose it for him.

                       LUKE
             I only wish Ben were here.

    Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
    heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and
    grabs his arm.

                       BIGGS
             Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
             get here... are you going out with
             us?!

                       LUKE
             Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
             with you! Listen, have I got some
             stories to tell...
                                                       123.


Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.

                  RED LEADER
        Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
        been checked out on the Incom T-
        sixty- five?

                  BIGGS
        Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
        the outer rim territories.

Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
his fighter.

                  RED LEADER
        I met your father once when I was
        just a boy, he was a great pilot.
        You'll do all right. If you've got
        half of your father's skill, you'll
        do better than all right.

                  LUKE
        Thank you, sir. I'll try.

Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                  BIGGS
        I've got to get aboard. Listen,
        you'll tell me your stories when we
        come back. All right?

                  LUKE
        I told you I'd make it someday,
        Biggs.

                  BIGGS
             (going off)
        You did, all right. It's going to
        be like old times, Luke. We're a
        couple of shooting stars that'll
        never be stopped!

Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.

As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek,
deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the
craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a
socket on the back of the fighter.

                  CHIEF
                                                             124.


             This R2 unit of your seems a bit
             beat up. Do you want a new one?

                       LUKE
             Not on your life! That little droid
             and I have been through a lot
             together.
                  (to Artoo)
             You okay, Artoo?

    The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
    the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
    that he is fine.

    Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
    his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
    hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
    into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as
    Artoo beeps good-bye.

                       CHIEF
             Okay, easy she goes!

                       THREEPIO
             Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to
             come back.

    Artoo beeps in agreement.

                       THREEPIO (CONT’D)
             You wouldn't want my life to get
             boring, would you?

    Artoo whistles his reply.

    All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
    The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
    pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The
    hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted
    voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses
    are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
    shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A
    signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships.
    Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about
    through his goggles.

                       BEN'S VOICE
             Luke, the Force will be with you.

    Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.


209 EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE                                  209
                                                              125.


    All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard
    standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense
    jungle. The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally
    permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the
    thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships
    catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and
    disappears into the morning cloud cover.


210 INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM                                 210

    The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly
    before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its
    four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star
    moves ever closer to the system. A series of green dots
    appear around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter
    fills the war room.

                       MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE
             Stand-by alert. Death Star
             approaching. Estimated time to
             firing range, fifteen minutes.


211 EXT. SPACE                                                       211

    The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow
    surface of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters
    flying in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.


212 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE                                       212

    Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow
    around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in
    formation settle ominously in the foreground and very
    slowly pull away.


213 INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT                               213

    Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,
    looking to each side at his wing men.

                       RED LEADER
             All wings report in.


214 INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT                                             214

    head from side to side and makes beeping sounds.

    The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the
    Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X"
    position.


222 INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT                                             222

224 INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT                            224

    Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the
    approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted
    slightly.

                       RED LEADER
                  (over headset)
             Switch your deflectors on.

    The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The
    Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly
    in size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on
    the metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish
    antenna is built into the surface on one side.


227 INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT                                            227

229 EXT. SPACE                                                    229

    As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome
    size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half
    of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area
    sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin
    lines and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat
    like a city at night as seen from a weather satellite.


230 INT. GOLD LEADER'S COCKPIT                                    230

             Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

                       RED LEADER
                  (over headset)
             I copy, Gold Leader.

                       GOLD LEADER
             We're starting for the target shaft
             now.


231 INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT                                     231

    Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star
    looming in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and
    forth in the background. He moves his computer targeting
    device into position.

                       RED LEADER
             We're in position. I'm going to cut
             across the axis and try and draw
             their fire.


232 EXT. SPACE                                                    232

    Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive
    towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow
    across the dark grey expanse of the huge station.


233 INT. DEATH STAR                                                  233

    Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-
    powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate
    the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting
    devices.


234 EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR                                 234

    Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel
    X- wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the
    Death Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces
    and fires.


235 INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM                                 235

    Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.
    Threepio is at her side.

    An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.


237 INT. DEATH STAR                                                  237

    Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute

    Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the
    monstrous fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the
    cockpit window.

                       LUKE
             This is Red Five; I'm going in!


241 EXT. SPACE                                                       241

    Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts
    streak from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball
    explosion on the dim surface.


242 INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT                             242

    Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able
    to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

                       BIGGS
                  (over headset)
             Luke, pull up!


243 EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR                                       243

    Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading
    edges of his wings slightly scorched.


244 INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT                                              244

             Are you all right?


245 INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT                             245

    Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief.
    Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

                       LUKE
             I got a little cooked, but I'm
             okay.


246 EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR                                   246

    Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface
    with laserbolts.


247 INT. DEATH STAR                                                  247

    Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in
    all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.
    Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and
    foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers
    rushes up to him.

                       ASTRO-OFFICER
             We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord
             Vader. But they're so small they're
             evading our turbo-lasers!

                       VADER
             We'll have to destroy them ship to
             ship. Get the crews to their
             fighters.


248 INT. DEATH STAR                                                  248

    Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up
    their turbine generators to create sufficient power. The
    crew rushes about preparing for another blast. Even the
    troopers head gear is not adequate to protect them from the
    overwhelming noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers
    bangs his helmet with his hand in an attempt to stop the
    ringing.


249 INT. READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING          249

    Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

                       RED LEADER
             Luke, let me know when you're going
             in.

    The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose
    down and starts his attack dive.

                       LUKE
             I'm on my way in now...

                       RED LEADER

             Watch yourself! There's a lot of
             fire coming from the right side of
             that deflection tower.

                       LUKE
             I'm on it.


251 EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR                                  251

    Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the
    horizon and down onto the dim grey surface.


252 EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING                                    252

    A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the
    onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar
    emplacements erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a
    protruding tower on the surface.


253 INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING                        253

    The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window
    as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of
    his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

    The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he
    maneuvers his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels
    away from the surface towards the heavens.

    The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate
    throughout the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about
    in the smoke and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual
    flash of explosions.

    Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces
    nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides
    technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls.
    Dodonna watches quietly from one corner. One of the
    officers working over a screen speaks into his headset.

                       CONTROL OFFICER
             Squad leaders, we've picked up a
             new group of signals. Enemy

    Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching
    Imperial fighters.

                       LUKE
             My scope's negative. I don't see

    the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

                       RED LEADER
             Keep up your visual scanning. With
             all this jamming, they'll be on top
             of you before your scope can pick
             them up.


261 EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR                                   261

    Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star
    horizon, four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the
    Rebel fighters. Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop
    out of frame. Pan with the remaining two TIE ships.

    Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The
    horizon in the background twists around as he peels off,
    hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

             Biggs! You've picked one up...
             watch it!

    Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely

    Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to
    normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

             Computer's locked. Getting a
             signal.

    As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly
    all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the
    trench as the surface whips past in a blur.

             faster this time. I can't hold

476 INT. DEATH STAR                                               476

    Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff
    Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

                       INTERCOM VOICE
             Standing by.

    The rumble of a distant explosion begins.


477 EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR                              477

    The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like
    Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small
    flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a
    supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.
                                                            166.


478 INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                               478

                       HAN
             Great shot, kid. That was one in a
             million.


479 INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT                           479

    Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

                       BEN'S VOICE
             Remember, the Force will be with
             you... always.

    The ship rocks back and forth.


480 EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER                                 480

    Vader's ship spins off into space.


481 EXT. SPACE                                                     481

    The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.


482 INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR                            482

    Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a
    throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the
    ladder as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and
    shouting. Princess Leia rushes toward him.

                       LEIA
             Luke! Luke! Luke!

    She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance
    around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they
    embrace one another, slapping each other on the back.

                       HAN
                  (laughing)
             Hey! Hey!

                       LUKE
                  (laughing)
             I knew you'd come back! I just knew
             it!

                       HAN
                                                           167.


             Well, I wasn't gonna let you get
             all the credit and take all the
             reward.

    Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves
    at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

                       LEIA
                  (laughing)
             Hey, I knew there was more to you
             than money.

    Luke looks toward the ship.

                       LUKE
             Oh, no!

    The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the
    fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

                       THREEPIO
             Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say
             something!
                  (to mechanic)
             You can repair him, can't you?

                       TECHNICIAN
             We'll get to work on him right
             away.

                       THREEPIO
             You must repair him! Sir, if any of
             my circuits or gears will help,
             I'll gladly donate them.

                       LUKE
             He'll be all right.


483 INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM                      483
                                                       168.


Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main
temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows.
Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in
white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the
others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before
Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined-
up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the
group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who
is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is
confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the
left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white
dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a
gold medallion around Han's neck. He winks at her. She then
repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event.
They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before
them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness.
